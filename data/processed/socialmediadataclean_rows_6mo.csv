The US imports somewhere in the neighborhood of $20-$26 billion in chips each year, and there is no way we are replacing even a fraction any time soon. 

One trillion chips were sold globally in 2023.

This means the cost of everything electronic is going to skyrocket, which also means any product that relies on anything electronic in its supply chain is going to skyrocket, e.g. anything trucked, production lines using computers, anything refrigerated, medical devices, anything printed, *virtually every product made*. And we go back to Covid-era shitty consumer goods. 

Own an iPhone? $250 of the price is the chips so now you can just tack that on to the price and it’s going to be about $735 just to *make*. 

Build more American factories, you say? The price increases four to five times that of imports. So US companies will buy abroad because it’s A. available and B. still cheaper.

This will drive us into a depression that will make the Great Depression seem like a party.

Yall really shouldn’t be investing in anything but the overall market, yall don't seem to understand much about the world. Amazon is fundamentally an engineering company if they’re keeping or hiring engineers, that’s a good thing and if they are firing middle management, that is an extremely good thing.


You’re reading headlines without understanding what’s behind them. The AWS outage? That was a routine technical issue — they happen all the time. How exactly is someone with a business degree supposed to help hardware, software, or network engineers keep the internet running? They don’t. They just clog up the process with meetings, status updates, and unnecessary approvals — basically slowing down the people actually doing the work.

Middle management is one of the biggest problems in modern corporations. Most of them have no clue what the company actually builds, how it’s built, or how to make it better. They exist mostly as roadblocks — more focused on self-preservation than productivity.

Honestly, a lot of people in middle management would’ve been better off learning a trade.

2025-05-15,JPM,comment,r/stocks,msgwwf9,t3_1kn7vz6,duboilburner,2,,0.981,,"Markets kind of got ahead of themselves, in large part due to the chaotic and inconsistent nature of the administration.

Once that initial scare happened, and then the administration softened their tone, we started going back up, and then some short-covering began, which fueled the fire to the upside even more.

But, now that we've thoroughly shaken out an initial reaction to the tariff situation, now we get to wait to see the actual real world effects start to trickle into the employment numbers, consumer spending, and ultimately, earnings.

Once a negative trend has been established there, then yes, longer term bear market on.

We will likely enter a period of stagflation for many years to come after that. We'll have some growth after an initial slowdown, but we'll also have waves of inflation that kind of offsets the growth, so main street is once more the one getting pinched.

Look to the trends of the late '60s thru early 80s--look at fed funds rate, unemployment rate, initial jobless claims and SPX all overlaid one another in that period.. That's more likely what we're about to restart. That is bad news for long term equity holders. You won't be able to any longer rely on just buying and holding SPY or quality individual stocks and expect it to just sit for 30+ years and be a great payout.

The last 40 years were great for ever decreasing interest rates and ever appreciating asset prices. They also weren't so great for a good deal of the middle class as they get priced out of owning homes and such, but the cost of some goods has come down greatly to somewhat offset that (until recently).

Active management will be the only way to get ahead in the years to come.

As for the immediate future, tomorrow is a major monthly SPX options expiration, and next week on the 20th is a major VIX OpEx with massive exposures that can pin us around certain levels. As those roll off, we'll enter another period of price exploration with the potential for more downside. Although some of the GEX exposures I've looked at kind of make it seem like we could stay bullish through June 20, although some of the weekly bets for the second half of May are showing SPX at least with some big negative gamma exposures right at the levels we're at now--so--maybe we get some downside to end the month but then start to creep back up again. We'll see! Always possible that if we do start heading down next week that the June monthlies start to build more bearish exposures and we keep going down thru that June expiration--then there's the quarterly expirations that can keep us pinned at a level until they roll off, too.

  
This has been a wild quarter if you watch JPM's JHEQX collar trade. It rolled 3/30 to:

5905 short calls

5310 long puts

4480 short puts

The trade, as always, starts the quarter smack in the middle of their upper two strikes by design. But, within days, we were half way between the two put strikes and have since rallied all the way back to the short call strike and we're only half way thru the quarter.

THAT is WILD.

People like to take bets, the pin and pulling effects of the huge JPM trade, we do often end up ending the quarter close to either the short call strike or the long put strike. If the 'window of weakness' we're about to enter does make us take a bearish turn, there's a strong likelihood that by June 30, we end near 5310. Also plausible that we correct back down from the extreme up move in recent weeks to end May, and then grind back upto 5905 to end the quarter.

Also, not unheard of to expire about 5% above the short call strike in an extra bullish quarter.

We'll see! I'll wait for the VIX OpEx next week to feel out what direction the market is likely picking for the next couple weeks at least.",Markets kind of got ahead of themselves in large part due to the chaotic and inconsistent nature of the administration Once that initial scare happened and then the administration softened their tone we started going back up and then some short covering began which fueled the fire to the upside even more But now that we ve thoroughly shaken out an initial reaction to the tariff situation now we get to wait to see the actual real world effects start to trickle into the employment numbers consumer spending and ultimately earnings Once a negative trend has been established there then yes longer term bear market on We will likely enter a period of stagflation for many years to come after that We ll have some growth after an initial slowdown but we ll also have waves of inflation that kind of offsets the growth so main street is once more the one getting pinched Look to the trends of the late 60s thru early 80s look at fed funds rate unemployment rate initial jobless claims and SPX all overlaid one another in that period That s more likely what we re about to restart That is bad news for long term equity holders You won t be able to any longer rely on just buying and holding SPY or quality individual stocks and expect it to just sit for 30 years and be a great payout The last 40 years were great for ever decreasing interest rates and ever appreciating asset prices They also weren t so great for a good deal of the middle class as they get priced out of owning homes and such but the cost of some goods has come down greatly to somewhat offset that until recently Active management will be the only way to get ahead in the years to come As for the immediate future tomorrow is a major monthly SPX options expiration and next week on the 20th is a major VIX OpEx with massive exposures that can pin us around certain levels As those roll off we ll enter another period of price exploration with the potential for more downside Although some of the GEX exposures I ve looked at kind of make it seem like we could stay bullish through June 20 although some of the weekly bets for the second half of May are showing SPX at least with some big negative gamma exposures right at the levels we re at now so maybe we get some downside to end the month but then start to creep back up again We ll see Always possible that if we do start heading down next week that the June monthlies start to build more bearish exposures and we keep going down thru that June expiration then there s the quarterly expirations that can keep us pinned at a level until they roll off too This has been a wild quarter if you watch JPM s JHEQX collar trade It rolled 3 30 to 5905 short calls 5310 long puts 4480 short puts The trade as always starts the quarter smack in the middle of their upper two strikes by design But within days we were half way between the two put strikes and have since rallied all the way back to the short call strike and we re only half way thru the quarter THAT is WILD People like to take bets the pin and pulling effects of the huge JPM trade we do often end up ending the quarter close to either the short call strike or the long put strike If the window of weakness we re about to enter does make us take a bearish turn there s a strong likelihood that by June 30 we end near 5310 Also plausible that we correct back down from the extreme up move in recent weeks to end May and then grind back upto 5905 to end the quarter Also not unheard of to expire about 5 above the short call strike in an extra bullish quarter We ll see I ll wait for the VIX OpEx next week to feel out what direction the market is likely picking for the next couple weeks at least

His comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.

""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,"" Trump said in a social media post.

""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.""

A representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.

Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.

As a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.

Every week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.

Walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.

&gt; The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June. That decline also marked the end of a structural bull cycle for the dollar, which started in 2010 and ended in 2024 with an accumulated gain of about 40%. 

&gt; Although the currency strengthened 3.2% in July, recovering some of this year’s depreciation, Morgan Stanley Research expects the decline to continue, possibly adding another 10% in losses by the end of next year.  “We're likely at the intermission rather than the finale,” says David Adams, head of G10 FX Strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The second act for the dollar’s weakening should come over the next 12 months, as U.S. interest rates and growth converge with those of the rest of the world.” 

&gt; The U.S. currency depreciation could have significant impacts for consumers, businesses, investors and ultimately for the overall economy: It would be more expensive for Americans to travel abroad. U.S. assets could be less compelling for foreign investors. Import prices could rise, putting pressure on inflation.

In reality, it's a stock that is way over hyped, and is high purely based on meme. In Q1 of 2025, they earned only $19 billion in revenue, and worse, only $409 million in net profit. Their market cap was $1 trillion then. They are probably going to finish Q2 in the red because of dwindling sales. Their P/E ratio was about 181 last week, and this week it fell to 151. For those who don't know, a P/E ratio is equivalent to how long it will take your annual earnings off of your share to recoup how much you purchased the share for, aka, a P/E of 10, means it will take you 10 years to earn back the price of your share, so 151 means it's abiut 151 years before you earn your money back for how much you paid for the share. The higher that ratio is, the more overvalued the company is. 

Ford, which has a market cap of $40 billion had Q1 revenue of $40.7 billion, and net revenue of $471 million with a P/E of 8.22. Honda does even better with a P/E of 7.82, and they were down 9% in revenue compared to last year. 

So, by comparison, Tesla is grossly overvalued. Their cars suck. Their CEO sucks. And they are finally catching up to where they should be, which is a Market cap of about $20 to $60 billion, at best, technically lower since they have always had lower sales than all of the other car companies.",You guys keep posting about Tesla like it s this magical company that prints money In reality it s a stock that is way over hyped and is high purely based on meme In Q1 of 2025 they earned only $19 billion in revenue and worse only $409 million in net profit Their market cap was $1 trillion then They are probably going to finish Q2 in the red because of dwindling sales Their P E ratio was about 181 last week and this week it fell to 151 For those who don t know a P E ratio is equivalent to how long it will take your annual earnings off of your share to recoup how much you purchased the share for aka a P E of 10 means it will take you 10 years to earn back the price of your share so 151 means it s abiut 151 years before you earn your money back for how much you paid for the share The higher that ratio is the more overvalued the company is Ford which has a market cap of $40 billion had Q1 revenue of $40 7 billion and net revenue of $471 million with a P E of 8 22 Honda does even better with a P E of 7 82 and they were down 9 in revenue compared to last year So by comparison Tesla is grossly overvalued Their cars suck Their CEO sucks And they are finally catching up to where they should be which is a Market cap of about $20 to $60 billion at best technically lower since they have always had lower sales than all of the other car companies

2025-10-22,TSLA,post,r/stocks,1octyv8,,Puginator,4114,346.0,0.9413,Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan,"A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.

On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.

Tesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.

On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.

The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.

“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”

Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk’s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.

Following those firms’ suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, “ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla’s proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.” The company added that shareholders who sold would “have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.”

The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.

Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.

Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having \~25% voting control.” The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.

Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he “vociferously opposes this pay package” and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.

“Most of the time we’ve held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it’s grown over time, and that’s why we haven’t chosen to dump it,” Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he’s preferred to “hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.”

Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.

He said he views Tesla’s board he as “insufficiently independent,” and that it’s allowed Musk to be an “absentee CEO.” The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.

The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it’s still underperforming its tech peers and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.

Musk has “been an inconsistent CEO at best,” Lander said, “and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.”

Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

What happened?

They started with some money, lost almost all of it

Had about $150,000 in stocks (mainly NVDA).
Market dipped, their account dropped to just $526.
Added $10,000 more to try again.

They switched focus to Google (GOOG/GOOGL)

Thought it was undervalued (low P/E ratio + strong AI future).
Started betting on it with options.

What kind of bets?

They bought calls → basically betting the stock would go up.
Specifically, they bought 5% OTM calls 30 days out:
OTM (Out of the Money) = strike price a little above current stock price.
30 days out = options expiring in about a month.
On red days (when the stock dipped), they bought cheap calls.
When the stock went up and calls became profitable (in the money), they sold.
Then they used the profits to buy even more contracts → snowball effect.

The big move

Right before Labor Day, they had $450,000 in cash from previous trades.
They dumped it all into 220 strike calls (expiring Oct 17) when Google dipped to $207.
Those calls cost about $4.70 each, and they bought 950 contracts.
Next trading day → calls shot up in value.
They sold at $16 per contract → turning $450K into ~$1.5M.

Instead of buying actual candy bars, you buy tickets that let you buy candy bars later at today’s price.
If candy bar prices rise, those tickets suddenly become super valuable.
You keep doing this: buy cheap tickets, sell when prices go up, use profits to buy more tickets.
One day, you put all your money into tickets, candy bars skyrocket, and boom → you’re rich.

You keep doing this: buy cheap tickets, sell when prices go up, use profits to buy more tickets.
One day, you put all your money into tickets, candy bars skyrocket, and boom → you’re rich.

2025-06-22,AMZN,comment,r/wallstreetbets,mz6erp8,t3_1lhs53w,[deleted],221,,-0.998,,"&gt;In 1953, Iran had a democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, who committed what, in the eyes of the British Empire and the United States, was an unforgivable sin: he nationalized Iran’s oil industry. 

&gt;For decades, British Petroleum (then the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) had extracted Iran’s wealth, leaving the Iranian people with little to show for it. Mossadegh’s move was a bid for sovereignty, dignity, and the right of a nation to control its own resources. The response from the so-called “free world” was swift and brutal: a joint CIA-MI6 operation, code-named Operation Ajax, orchestrated a coup to overthrow Mossadegh, using black propaganda, bribed politicians, manufactured riots, and false flag attacks to create chaos and justify intervention. Hundreds died in the streets of Tehran as the Shah—an autocratic monarch—was reinstalled with American and British backing.

&gt;This single act of imperial violence shattered Iran’s democracy and set the stage for everything that followed: decades of dictatorship under the authoritarian Shah, the rise of the secret police (trained and armed by the CIA), the deepening of anti-Western sentiment, and ultimately the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It’s not a stretch to say that the roots of today’s tensions, the cycles of violence, and the specter of war all trace back to this original sin. The aftershocks of that coup are still being felt, not only in Iran, but across the entire Middle East.

&gt;Yet, in the American imagination, history often starts with the hostage crisis, or with the latest missile launch, or with the rhetoric of “rogue states.” We’re taught to see Iran as an irrational enemy, a threat to “our” interests, never as a nation whose modern history was violently derailed by foreign powers seeking oil and geopolitical dominance. The coup became a blueprint for U.S. and British interventions around the world, fueling a legacy of distrust, blowback, and endless war.

&gt;This is not ancient history. The U.S. government only formally admitted its role in the coup in 2013, after decades of denial and the destruction of key documents. The British government’s involvement was only acknowledged even more recently. The details are staggering: CIA operatives posing as communists bombing mosques to stir up religious opposition, paying mobsters to riot in the streets, and bribing editors to print fake news-long before “fake news” became a household phrase.

&gt;So when Americans beat the drums of war with Iran, or wonder aloud “why do they hate us?”, we have to reckon with the fact that the U.S. and U.K. destroyed Iran’s best chance at democracy for the sake of oil profits and imperial power. 

&gt;Imagine if a foreign power overthrew your government, installed a dictator, and then lectured you for decades about freedom and democracy. Imagine if, every time you tried to chart your own course, you were met with sanctions, threats, and military intervention.

&gt;The story of Iran is not unique. It’s a microcosm of the broader pattern of Western interventionism: democracy is celebrated only when it aligns with the interests of empire. When democracy threatens those interests—when a nation dares to control its own resources, or refuses to play by the rules of the global order—it is crushed, and the consequences are borne by ordinary people for generations.

&gt;This is not about excusing the crimes or authoritarianism of the Iranian regime. It’s about understanding the context that gave rise to it, and the role that Western powers played in destroying the possibility of a different, more peaceful future. It’s about recognizing that the seeds of today’s conflicts were planted by yesterday’s coups, sanctions, and covert operations.

&gt;If we truly want peace, if we want to avoid another catastrophic war, the first step is honesty. We have to confront our own history, acknowledge the violence committed in our name, and reject the amnesia that allows us to repeat the same mistakes over and over. Until we do, every new crisis will be haunted by the ghosts of 1953—and the world will continue to pay the price for our refusal to learn from the past.

The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.

Below is a long version of how it all came to be: 

I first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  

Edit: I looked up the actual purchase numbers and the number of shares was actually 27 at $110 but since Nvidia had split multiple times, the number shown in my report today was reflecting those splits.  End of edit 

Back in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  

Over the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  

2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn’t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today 

I remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  

Then in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  

Then in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  

Seemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  

The last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  

Jump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  

I should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. 

Here are the raw numbers:

Total invested: $36,352
Total sale: $1,059,591
Total gains: $1,023,238
Average cost per share: $5.60
Time to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!


I know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.

Back in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  

Over the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  

2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn’t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today 

I remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  

Then in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  

Then in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  

Seemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  

The last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  

Jump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  

I should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. 

Here are the raw numbers:

Total invested: $36,352
Total sale: $1,059,591
Total gains: $1,023,238
Average cost per share: $5.60
Time to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!


I know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.

2025-07-10,TSLA,post,r/investing,1lw0ltf,,HudyBudyFudyWhudy,11376,1095.0,0.9986,Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio,"Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.

Below is a long version of how it all came to be: 

I first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.

	1.	China: “We’ll restrict exports.”
Trump: “Hold my Diet Coke… let’s tax everything!”
	2.	The man just turned the U.S.–China trade war into a full-blown trade apocalypse. The S&amp;P 500 immediately fainted.
	3.	China controls ~90% of the world’s rare earth supply. Translation: they sneeze, and your iPhone dies.
	4.	Tariffs this high are basically punching yourself in the face to teach your neighbor a lesson.
	5.	U.S. companies importing Chinese parts? Congrats — you’re now paying double and probably laying off people too.
	6.	“Export controls on software”? Great, now your laptop might need a passport.

Trump: “Hold my Diet Coke… let’s tax everything!”

	3.	China controls ~90% of the world’s rare earth supply. Translation: they sneeze, and your iPhone dies.

For example, according to ERISA, any company who takes 401k money may not be allowed to engage in stock buybacks. If you had people investing 401k funds in some giant company like Apple, any Apple stock buyback is arguably a breach of fiduciary duty

The short term corporate profit drive of PE and the rules of ERISA cannot coexist

Frankly it'll cause huge legal tangle ups to anyone private who takes this money unless Congress basically removes ERISA

It might be fine for smart people who sock it away in VT or VOO or SPY like **they already can do perfectly fine**, but a lot of dumbasses will throw their retirement money down the drain and get screwed.

Whenever you hear a snotty (and frustrated) European middlebrow presenting his stereotypes about Americans, he will often describe them as “uncultured,” “unintellectual,” and “poor in math” because, unlike his peers, Americans are not into equation drills and the constructions midbrows call “high culture”—like knowledge of Goethe’s inspirational (and central) trip to Italy, or familiarity with the Delft school of painting. 

Yet the person making these statements is likely to be addicted to his iPod, wear blue jeans, and use Microsoft Word to jot down his “cultural” statements on his PC, with some Google searches here and there interrupting his composition. 

🇺🇸Well, it so happens that America is currently far, far more creative than these nations of museumgoers and equation solvers. It is also far more tolerant of bottom-up tinkering and undirected trial and error. And globalization has allowed the United States to specialize in the creative aspect of things, the production of concepts and ideas, that is, the scalable part of the products, and, increasingly, by exporting jobs, separate the less scalable components and assign them to those happy to be paid by the hour.

Sure, they existed before the bubble and the products you're listing are pre-AI products. Nobody is worried about those products. Except maybe Nvidia since while their product existed before, their volume and structure and valuation has tilted entirely towards the actual AI companies.

What people are worried about are (1) OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and every VC cash awash AI startup that _doesn't_ have profitable products and (2) the portion of the valuation of the preexisting companies attributable to the AI bubble.

I mean yeah, Kraft existed before the AI bubble and had products then. But if they started selling shitcoins in 2019 and their valuation tripled from blockchain hype alone, it's true that they had Mac &amp; Cheese before but maybe the new 60% of their stock price is at risk when that bubble pops. _At best_ they drop to pre-bubble levels but probably worse since they presumably diverted investment from the preexisting units into bubble projects and now they're behind on their core business.

Write your post again but instead of ""Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta"" say ""IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Compaq, Intel, Oracle"" and tell us again why that bubble won't be so bad.

2025-11-05,GOOG,comment,r/investing,nnalrrt,t3_1opcsl8,skilliard7,54,,0.6428,,"&gt;The big difference is that the companies today actually make money. Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta they all have real products, billions in profits, and millions of users. Think of Google Maps, YouTube, Windows, Office, Android, Instagram etc. These are all solid products with billions in profits and massive user bases. Can you replace them? No. Will they go away anytime soon? Also no. Even if the AI trend slows down, these companies still have strong foundations and cash flow from their non-AI products.

You could say the same about Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, IBM, and many others in the 90's. There were lots of highly profitable tech companies.

The danger isn't that MSFT/Google/Nvidia/Meta will go bankrupt. The danger is the AI startups that are massively unprofitable, that are renting cloud capacity from the biggest tech companies. Most EPS growth from big tech comes  from cloud growth, renting out capacity.

There are some pretty stupid AI startups. From the tech bubble, at least pets.com provided a useful product to consumers, it was just unprofitable. There are some pretty useless AI startups like this one https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/ai-startup-friend-spent-more-than-1m-on-all-those-subway-ads/

The massive overbuild of capacity will result in lots of losses for cloud providers when demand from unprofitable startups wanes.

But the bigger deal is that we'll all be exposed to what the US GDP is like without that infra spending, which from reports, is near zero growth.

2025-09-22,MSFT,comment,r/investing,nfnmjc7,t3_1nlz8t7,generallydisagree,1,,0.9965,,"So to be clear, the Tech industry's claim is that the H1B Visas are vital to their future - it allows them to hire the best and brightest tech people in the world (not just from the USA).  

Now, an H1B visa spans 3 to 6 years - but can continue on for decades!  You see, if Microsoft hires the ""Best and Brightest"" from a foreign country on an H1B - the come for let's say the 6 year time period.  But if they then apply for permanent residency/green card status, or even other residency opportunities, their H1B is automatically extended while their application process (typically lasting many, many years) remains in place.  There are people who first came to the US for an H1B job 15 years ago - and remain employed as H1B employees to this day - even though the terms of their H1B has long expired (because that's how our system is set up and they are not part of the endless waiting line of having the status request processed, approved/denied, etc. . . ).

The next question is, if somebody is one of the best and brightest in the world of the tech industry - they are probably making tons of money.  So much money that a one-time fee of $100,000 upon hiring them as an H1B employee would be a drop in the bucket.  

Of course, if a tech company is claiming to hire a global best and brightest and pay them $75,000 per year - is that claim of best and brightest really legitimate?  Or are they just hiring that person at sub-standard wages (for the job type) to avoid paying somebody else (ie. an American) more?

India accounts for roughly 70% of H1B employment jobs in the USA.  The USA is not particularly pleased with India at the moment.  China accounts for about 13% of H1B jobs in the USA.  The USA is not particularly pleased with China at the moment.  The impact of H1B US-based employees sending money home to India is actually a pretty big deal.  As is their returning home with large winnings and starting their own tech-based businesses in India.  For China - how much of it is really about IP theft?  Between sending their ""kids"" to US colleges and getting US jobs in tech and other key industries - where China is coincidentally well known for IP theft . . . is the H1B jobs for Chines just a free entry to steel from the US tech sector?  And what else is at risk?

The US awards 65,000 standard H1B visas per year.  At $100K each, that's $6.5 billion.  Of course, the USA issues a LOT more than 65,000 H1B visas per year - these are the Cap Exempt category, and are for jobs in universities, not-for-profits, etc. . . there are more of these H1B visas issued each year than the 65,000 annually for the high skill job-set.  There is no limit on the number of these cap-exempt H1B visas.",So to be clear the Tech industry s claim is that the H1B Visas are vital to their future it allows them to hire the best and brightest tech people in the world not just from the USA Now an H1B visa spans 3 to 6 years but can continue on for decades You see if Microsoft hires the Best and Brightest from a foreign country on an H1B the come for let s say the 6 year time period But if they then apply for permanent residency green card status or even other residency opportunities their H1B is automatically extended while their application process typically lasting many many years remains in place There are people who first came to the US for an H1B job 15 years ago and remain employed as H1B employees to this day even though the terms of their H1B has long expired because that s how our system is set up and they are not part of the endless waiting line of having the status request processed approved denied etc The next question is if somebody is one of the best and brightest in the world of the tech industry they are probably making tons of money So much money that a one time fee of $100 000 upon hiring them as an H1B employee would be a drop in the bucket Of course if a tech company is claiming to hire a global best and brightest and pay them $75 000 per year is that claim of best and brightest really legitimate Or are they just hiring that person at sub standard wages for the job type to avoid paying somebody else ie an American more India accounts for roughly 70 of H1B employment jobs in the USA The USA is not particularly pleased with India at the moment China accounts for about 13 of H1B jobs in the USA The USA is not particularly pleased with China at the moment The impact of H1B US based employees sending money home to India is actually a pretty big deal As is their returning home with large winnings and starting their own tech based businesses in India For China how much of it is really about IP theft Between sending their kids to US colleges and getting US jobs in tech and other key industries where China is coincidentally well known for IP theft is the H1B jobs for Chines just a free entry to steel from the US tech sector And what else is at risk The US awards 65 000 standard H1B visas per year At $100K each that s $6 5 billion Of course the USA issues a LOT more than 65 000 H1B visas per year these are the Cap Exempt category and are for jobs in universities not for profits etc there are more of these H1B visas issued each year than the 65 000 annually for the high skill job set There is no limit on the number of these cap exempt H1B visas

2025-09-12,ORCL,post,r/investing,1nf46bi,,OverwroughtPraise,1430,100.0,0.8796,Is Oracle just SoftBank wearing a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

The Oracle accounting scandal of 1990 involved the company overstating its revenues and profits by prematurely recognizing sales, particularly from aggressive ""up-front"" marketing tactics and unperformed consulting work

Oracle's sales teams were pressured to secure large upfront software sales, which contributed to the overstatement of revenue. The company recognized revenue for consulting work that had not yet been performed or was performed without a contract.

1.When Jensen Huang immigrated to the U.S. as a kid, he ended up in a small rural town and got bullied pretty badly. But instead of reacting with defiance or lashing out, he just smiled and brushed it off. Calm and quiet resilience.

He later said he got into physical training thanks to a roommate, and he started doing tons of push-ups. Eventually, his build changed and that might’ve naturally put an end to the bullying.
	
2.He was really good at table tennis. He seriously considered going pro during his school years. Even after founding NVIDIA, he kept a ping pong table in the office, tucked away in the corner.

3.He’s always been this upbeat, warm-hearted kind of guy. He didn’t like cutting people loose. That’s why NVIDIA’s hiring process was notoriously tough. His philosophy was that if you hire carefully, you won’t need to fire.

At a public meeting one day, he pressed a junior employee, asking, “What value are you delivering here at NVIDIA compared to what you’re paid?” The guy was crushed by it. But later, when that same employee was diagnosed with a rare illness, Jensen tried to cover his treatment personally from his own pocket.

4.He wasn’t like this back in his AMD days, but once he became a CEO, “Hwaung's rage” became a thing. Not in a toxic but more like explosive passion when he disagrees with something. People say that ""If you’ve experienced his rage, you’ve become part of the inner circle at NVIDIA""

5.Around 2014(I don't remember exactly) a junior engineer who was lazy but quite creative noticed a potential link between deep learning and NVIDIA chips. Despite having a relatively low performance record, the guy went straight to Jensen and pitched his idea with everything he had. Maybe he figured he had nothing to lose.

Jensen listened. Then he ripped the roadmap off the wall and declared, “This is our future.”
From that moment on, NVIDIA bet everything on AI. CUDA became the heart of their strategy, and they poured everything into developing GPUs optimized for machine learning.

Moody’s Ratings on Monday downgraded the long-term ratings of several of America’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), citing weakened prospects of federal support following Friday’s U.S. sovereign downgrade. The move marks a rare blow to the top tier of the U.S. financial system and may raise borrowing costs and regulatory pressure on institutions still seen as systemically important.

The rating agency lowered deposit ratings, senior unsecured debt, and counterparty risk assessments for key subsidiaries and branches of the banks to Aa2 from Aa1. These ratings had previously included a notch of uplift tied to the government’s Aaa rating, support Moody’s no longer deems as fully credible following the downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt to Aa1.

   It makes no sense. Byd will eliminate tesla in Asia 100%! It's not a matter of ""if"", but aatter of ""when"". Tesla has the upper had 10yrs ago, but Elon Lost track and got too full of himself. BYD had a focused leader, not addicted to ketamine, making people pay attention to him at all times, and not trying to run 4 other companies. Tesla lost their 1st innovation status.
BYD has cars for all classes. They even have an all electric car that costs like $15k! That's insane! So, while byd brought ev's to the masses, tesla went with the $80k Cybertruck that has so many issues they can't give them away now. 

Seriously, what is tesla? A car company? software company? Self-driving tech? A tech innovation company? AI company? EV charging? Robotics? 
They can't clearly define what their mission is, and I believe thats purely cause Elon wants to keep pumping the company/ Stock price. 

I literally just bought a byd car last week. PHEV. The car is awesome. I've been running it in electric mode pretty much the entire time. It's half the price, reviews say it's better quality, comes with an 8yr warranty on the battery, and it makes teslas look ""old"" now.

Asia doesn't even have a negative view of Elon. So, they're not buying teslas based 100% on market competition. Tesla has lost.
Europe, Canada, Mexico, and S America hate Elon, they hate trump, and then they associate Elon with Trump. So they won't buy a Tesla for market reasons and out of negative brand image. The only thing protecting tesla in the US is the 100% ev tariff, but as Ford, GM, and locally produced Hyundai ev's compete, tesla will lose that advantage as well.

2. American voters who vote Republican will continue to blame democrats. Against all odds. 

3. Even if tariffs worked and everyone shifted production to USA it will still be even more expensive than producing in China and paying tariffs. 

4. Even if they made it cheaper to produce in USA  due to AI and robotics, it will still be expensive because they can charge more on tariff excuses and need to recoup R&amp;D costs for that robotics research and factory production in USA.

5. Even if somehow all of this succeeded and they actually hired Americans and manufacturing jobs returned while keeping costs under control through some miracle, it’s still going to be higher labour costs in USA because medical insurance is expensive here due to healthcare being the most expensive it is in the world.

6. Even if all that succeeded and we got American jobs to boom, it still won’t make us rich as a country. Because those kind of jobs and technologies don’t even make a fraction of the money for USA that a single tech company like Apple can make through their whole China to USA production pipeline. It will still make us poorer than today. Because if those manufacturing jobs and becoming a powerhouse of manufacturing actually made countries super rich, then China would’ve been number 1. Truth is that those jobs and that manufacturing commerce no longer leads to insane profits like how tech companies make through innovation. It just can’t beat the latter.

For a man who occupied the highest office in the land, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated a fundamental ignorance—or worse, a deliberate rejection—of the basic principles that guide the American republic.

The U.S. government is built on a system of checks and balances, with three coequal branches: the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial. This design is not optional. It is the very core of our constitutional democracy. But Trump has routinely acted as if the presidency alone should dictate national direction, showing open disdain for congressional authority and treating the judiciary as a personal obstacle rather than an independent arbiter of law.

His frequent public attacks on judges—especially those who ruled against him—undermined the legitimacy of the courts. His refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas, stonewalling of investigations, and sweeping claims of executive privilege were direct assaults on legislative oversight. And his rhetoric, often laced with authoritarian undertones, revealed a deep frustration with a system that dares to question or restrain him.

Trump doesn’t just misunderstand how the country works—he actively resents it. He views institutions not as essential to democracy, but as impediments to his will. This isn’t strength. It’s a dangerous ignorance dressed up as leadership.

For someone who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, Trump has shown little interest in its actual contents.

Alot of silly trades do quite well. This was a lucky bet. Along w/ anyone that bought the dip on April 9th. Our odds were half chance. I happen to be in your camp, I did quite a bit of buying at the lows, but in hindsight it worked out far better than what at the time was my base case or best case expectation for the next 6 months. Which reminds me. I had an unforgettable due diligence call w/ the head of E-Trade's investor relations team about 10y back. This was before they sold to Morgan Stanley. He explained to me that every retail trading account in their system had a decay rate and an expected life. In other words, all of their customers would eventually lose all their money, and so they had to reinvest a significant amount of capital into ads and promotions to find new traders and replace the accounts that would invariably lose all their money. Thankfully E-Trade's trove of marketing spend gave us the E-Trade baby, one of the best ad campaigns of all time. But the lasting lesson I took from that exchange is that ""trading"", the way that retail investors use the term, is just a casino. An institutional trader's job is not to guess market direction and timing. They make markets, they profit from the bid / ask within fixed income &amp; derivatives, or they pocket commission in the equity market. Even proprietary trading in the classical sense done at the large trading houses is anchored in the basic function of having capital, lots of capital, to provide liquidity at bid / ask. That's the lion's share of the P&amp;L, and it's why the GSs and Jane Streets of the world post black every quarter. Every once in a while they make a boat load when volatility allows for it.

2025-08-06,GOOG,post,r/options,1misfli,,esInvests,745,99.0,0.995,18 Years of Options,"**Long post TL;DR:** Save aggressively, learn options deeply, remember options themselves have no edge, your process defines your outcome, and adaptability wins.

I’ve been active here for about 5 years. I make it a point to engage because I remember being the new trader, convinced that trading could change my life.

This post is aimed at beginners and early intermediates (&lt;5 years in the market). These are five core lessons that meaningfully changed my trading trajectory.

**1. Saving is your highest leverage early-game move.**  
Saving $500 in a $5K account is a 10% “return.” You only get this kind of impact when your account is small (think “newbie gains” in the gym). That same $500 in a $1M account is 0.05%. Maximize it while you can.  
While building savings, you’re also choosing your trading path. You don’t need it fully mapped out, but if your goal is “max return for minimal effort,” odds are overwhelming you’ll fail. You’d be better off DCA’ing and maybe selling covered calls at a ratio that doesn’t cap upside. Even if options don’t become your specialty (which is statistically likely), the process will teach you decision-making, risk, and discipline—if you don’t blow up the account.

**2. Forget “target returns.” Focus on learning.**  
New traders obsess over returns and which “options” will get them there. It’s backwards. Playing basketball for three months then declaring “I’ll score 50 in the NBA tonight” is delusional. For your first years, anything above zero is a gift.  
Learn the craft. A shallow understanding of delta is useless. A “basic” grasp of the Greeks isn’t enough. Buying LEAPS because IVP is low shows you missed the volatility surface entirely. A fixed bias toward buying or selling will cost you. Market conditions will favor both at different times.

**3. Options have no inherent edge—profit mechanisms do.**  
Options are just a security type, with added nuance. They let you build precise positions to match your thesis, but the money comes from exploiting **profit mechanisms**—market effects that can be monetized—not from the fact you’re trading options.  
Momentum, drift, breakouts, risk premia, dividend capture… these are where the edges are. Whether you sell a put or buy a call, if the underlying goes down, you lose. Study both options mechanics and profit mechanisms in parallel.

**4. Process = Outcome.**  
A lazy process produces lazy results. My turning point came after my largest portfolio loss, when I stopped, evaluated everything, and built a written trading plan and detailed log. The act of creating them was as valuable as the tools themselves.  
I realized I’d been winging far more than I thought. My recommendation: start a trading plan (Google Doc or Notion) and a trading log (Google Sheets/Excel) immediately. Track everything. The insights compound over time.

**5. Adaptability is your survival skill.**  
Success in options comes from analyzing profit mechanisms, knowing which regimes they thrive in, understanding their behavior, and then overlaying strategies that best capture them. Static strategies die in changing markets.

**6. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.** 

We start trading with the goal of making as much money as fast as we can. The irony is the overwhelming majority of cases will end in complete loss of the account. If we can embrace the roadmap of learning to trade and maintain realistic expectations, you really can make a lot of money trading. There is no shortcutting the learning process. 

**7. Plan your time.** 

It's easy to spend a bunch of time bouncing all around. As a trader, there are (3) broad skill areas to focus on: Behavioral Psychology (your own); Market Fundamentals (how they work, basic math and stats, deep understanding of options behavior, etc); Process Improvement (effective processes and feedback loops are important). 

I would spend the first 6 months to a year not trading anything live but paper trading and allowing myself to bounce around and learn whatever I can. As I'm doing that, I would track a short list of ideas that might be worth re-visiting later. What's inefficient is deciding to go super far in detail on things without adequate context built. 



**Bottom line:**  
Trading options at a professional level as a retail trader is absolutely possible—but only with deliberate effort. Most people are trying to extract maximum reward for minimum work. That’s fine—buy and hold w/ DCA is exactly that. But if you choose the trading path, I urge you to embrace the work. You effectively need to complete a self directed dual undergrad with a six sigma ""belt"". This takes time - give yourself some slack but stay focused.

Net Options Sentiment: 95 (lots of bullish options flow leading into today)

Social Sentiment: 88 (people are buzzing again)

Short Pressure: 65

**Not saying what I’m doing, but general thought process:**

Selling CSPs a bit below current price = paid to maybe own GME cheaper

Covered calls if you’ve been holding = collect rent while it chops

Maybe even spreads if you wanna cap risk and still nibble on IV

Price action from the last week has IV jacked... Let the IV cool off and premiums melt.

One thing I have learned is that the trader that progressions is the trader that has “0” excuses left.
When I first started trading; I lost it all but even more important I blamed for the reason I lost it all.
Then my second go at it; I started changing by asking my self “what did you learn today” and then I lost it all. 
After 6 years of fighting the market I have learned this one thing and it changed me and my life forever. 
I decided to stop blaming the market, people around me, situations, FOMC, YouTube, and retreat to the silence and void.
There I found the solution to my problem and it was me all along.
I have in my life learned how to make decisions.
Simple right: No
FOLLOW ME: An effective decision is not correct all the time but is correct all the time (not a typo)
Effective decision making is based on “rules” and these rules can only be created by the trader individually (in my opinion) 
FVG, 15ORB, VWAP, etc but WHAT ARE YOUR RULES?
What’s the thing that propels you to pull the trigger and the most important question: 
Can you do it again and again and again? 
I have reached this point and it has cost me everything to get here and I desire to encourage others that felt the market of the market and believe that your decisions can change your family forever. 
Don’t fight the market: Fight yourself!

I got my money back.,"Do not sign up with Invest with Corey options trading course. He will ask for large sums of money and give little to no value. He and his team will make false promises of 10X returns, 5-10%+ returns and $10K-$20K monthly of guaranteed income when you join. He is a complete liar about his past experience in trading options. He claims to have years of experience in trading without proof. May also be lying to have a bachelors degree in finance. Because he had a previous business called ""Faymus Media"" and other money makers that failed in the past. He also claimed to go to Full Sail University, which he never went to. Also, Correy is likely in the USA Illegally.

Correy will ingnore typical refund requests. But when I threaten to report Invest with Corey and Whop to the FTC, IC3, ICE and to the local and New Jersey State Attorney General through sending emails to their support. I got a call from someone from Corey's team days later saying they will agree to refund. It will take a few days to process. I did get my money back. The support will use fake names like ""Rosh Japzon"" the one I saw in the support email of the refund.

Closed out my Yeti Calls today and LESL movement has helped my call options there but decided I’d keep them open since movement has been mostly upward this week. 1 strategy for LESL is already ITM since I purchased Monday when it was under 50 cents.

2025-06-02,MSFT,post,r/options,1l194ml,,StocksTok,366,56.0,0.91,New Cboe data shows a rise in retail algorithms trading 0DTE options!,"Cboe posted a chart recently showcasing the rise of retail algorithmic trading. I think this is fundamentally reshaping options market microstructure, as evidenced by the distinctive volume spikes at predictable intervals throughout the trading day. CBOE data reveals clear patterns of non-institutional volume clustering around 10 AM, 2 PM, and other key times, which is a telltale sign of basic retail algorithms executing predetermined strategies. 

My gut says this seems like simple time-based algorithms, momentum chasers, and basic mean reversion bots that retail traders can now access through platforms like Python libraries and simplified trading APIs. The concentration of this activity likely creates new intraday volatility patterns that experienced options traders can anticipate and exploit.

From a more technical perspective, the algorithms may lack the sophistication to account for complex Greeks interactions, potentially buying high IV options during panic periods and selling during consolidation phases. Weirdly, this may create opportunities for manual traders who understand gamma exposure and can position against these predictable flows. 

However, it also introduces new risks. The speed of execution means that traditional support and resistance levels can be blown through faster than human traders can react, and the clustering effect means that when these retail algos all trigger simultaneously, they can create flash moves that catch even experienced traders off-guard. I won't be surprised to see market makers adapt by widening spreads during these predictable volume windows.

It’s not super complex, but the volume impact is real. A lot of them seem to come in after the open settles, grab theta, and get flat before the 2 PM rush.

What’s wild is they move fast but trade blind — most of them don’t “see” IV or gamma exposure. They just follow signals. That’s where the edge is if you know how to read flow and position against it.

Market makers aren’t sleeping on this either you can already see signs like temporary spread widening or throttled quoting during those spike windows.

Gambling can be the stock markets, real estate, selling or buying insurance policies, casinos and more. So many things fall under that designation.  It is not bad to be a gambler, it just means you may be more aggressive vs conservative in your choices and take more risks.  It is very true that you can’t win if you’re not in the game and bigger risks bring bigger rewards and losses.

I have been trading stocks and options for over 35 years.  I have made 250k in a month and also lost $250k in a month before.  These past 3-5 months I lost 100k but instead of selling, I dollar cost averaged and bought more and have almost got it all back now in my options so I know the feeling of greed and not getting out before a great trade turns failed, many times and I will again.  I have also lost out by selling too quickly only to have the stock go on a run after I sold it.  But I made money and that was the point, I walked away with profit and the chance to trade another day.   You have to make hard decisions and remove ANY emotion from the equation.  In the end, it’s only about if your wins outdo your losses.  If you win 40% of the time but those wins equal more than your 60% of losses, that’s fine.   

It gets easier the longer you do it.  It’s like anything else you do over and over and get better at if you work hard at it.  Being a Gambler doesn’t make you a bad person nor does it automatically make you an addicted person.  I used to be in Advertising and loved what I did and always looked forward to Mondays to getting back to my work.  I was truly addicted to my work in a good way as the more I did the better I got and was a top 1% of a Fortune 500 company for over a decade.

But I am still in the trading and investment game and making my retirement from it.  I’m up till 1:30AM waiting for overnight markets to open to have an idea of tomorrows opening as well as getting up at 6am to plan anything I may need before market opens (on west coast).  Sunday nights I can’t wait for the market to open Monday like it’s Christmas Day every week!   Like you, I am obsessed with the market and all I learn from it.  But that is the key.  If you’re not learning about companies and how to make certain trades and what can happen on both sides of a trade, then you shouldn’t be trading.  The stock market is not a slot machine.  With a slot machine you have zero control, it’s all random.  With the stock market, if you focus on real companies making real profits and dividends then you have a chance to have some of your money grow for your future.  If you are just trading every day based on the news for the day or selling naked puts and calls and hoping and wishing…. You have zero control over what will happen and you will lose everything.

Think of where the country is going such as AI, Quantum Computing and Data Centers …. where are hedge funds and VC’s putting their money?  Then look up those companies and DO YOUR RESEARCH.  Major companies like Netflix, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Nividia, Palantir, Dominoes Pizza, Spotify, Shopify, Cava are just a few …. Think about the shoes you buy, the places you eat or shop, the subscriptions you have … are they good companies?  Will they be affected by price hikes from tariffs?  We don’t know if there will be any tariffs in the end because it’s a negotiation game and the pieces are always moving, so don’t bet on it cause you have no control over the moves.  Don’t bet for weeklies or daily trades cause you have no time for turnaround if things don’t go your way.  As a gambler, NEVER do margin, only trade with the money you own.  Do your research…. I can’t stress that enough - knowledge is power and the money will come if you are patient.

The stock market is not a get rich scheme.  If it does work that way for someone on a trade (meme stocks) trust me, they will lose it all within a week.  Check out the past charts of AMC and Game Stop, flew up fast and back down faster!  Don’t follow or trade something that is flying, find companies with long paths behind them.

Op, you sound like a really cool guy that has done what many others before you have done.  As some have said, it’s only money and you have time to make it back and more.  We all do the - “I could have, would have, should haves” for buying other things and trips not taken.  You gain nothing from swimming in guilt.  Get up and figure out how to make that money going forward, you are a smart guy. Don’t waste time on regrets, put them behind and focus forward.

Best advice from someone in the game a long time is to pick up your big boy pants and give yourself some money, not a lot, but enough to learn to trade small and build up your account.  If you’re going to do options, buy them for good companies with good earnings and instead of buying a lot, buy one close to ITM now but doesn’t expire for a year or two to give it time to grow.  Set alert’s for when it goes down 15, 20% and then decide either to get out or if it’s a normal downturn but a good company, then hang on. 

You can always paper trade as well to fine tune your skills.  But in the end, even all the analysts you see on TV make trading mistakes and the good ones admit it.

Sit down and write on paper what you want.  Do you want to grow a stock to 100k?  Then find companies with strong earnings and long time dividend increases each year and let it sit.  If you want to try options again, volatility makes them mover farther and faster but only buy one, ITM but longer expiration and watch it every day.  

The beauty I have learned about selling with modest gain vs a huge gain is that it will allow me to have my original basis back and then some extra money to buy again another day.  If I lose it all from being greedy, which I still am sometimes, I won’t be able to buy again.  A good way I do it is if an option skyrockets, I roll it a few months down the road, (always after their next earnings date to be able to catch any gain up to the earnings day) watching out for dividend dates, quarterly rebalancing triple witching Fridays … and then there’s real life stuff as well.  If I can take a profit equal to my original basis then I have 100% gain and my original money back while also staying in the game with the future option I just rolled into if the market continues to go up.  If it goes down, I’ve already profited and got my original basis back so if I lose on the roll, it’s not life threatening to me.

Anyway, I’m exhausted and I love to read what I write to others because I have to live by it as well and still learn from it and sometimes I still fall down, but I make sure I always get back up.

2025-05-23,MSFT,comment,r/options,mtrc7f9,t3_1kqv3lo,Uniklady,5,,0.9989,,"So much to say here. First, major ‘Gambler’s mentality’ here and I make no apologies for it.  Gambling can be the stock markets, real estate, selling or buying insurance policies, casinos and more. So many things fall under that designation.  It is not bad to be a gambler, it just means you may be more aggressive vs conservative in your choices and take more risks.  It is very true that you can’t win if you’re not in the game and bigger risks bring bigger rewards and losses.

I have been trading stocks and options for over 35 years.  I have made 250k in a month and also lost $250k in a month before.  These past 3-5 months I lost 100k but instead of selling, I dollar cost averaged and bought more and have almost got it all back now in my options so I know the feeling of greed and not getting out before a great trade turns failed, many times and I will again.

buy one close to ITM now but doesn t expire for a year or two to give it time to grow Set alert s for when it goes down 15 20 and then decide either to get out or if it s a normal downturn but a good

on paper what you want Do you want to grow a stock to 100k Then find companies with strong earnings and long time dividend increases each year and let it sit If you want to try options again volatility makes them mover farther and faster but only buy one ITM but longer expiration and watch it every day The beauty I have learned about selling with modest gain vs a huge gain is that it will allow me to have my original basis back and then some extra money to buy again another day If I lose it all from being greedy which I still am sometimes I won t be able to buy again A good way I do it is if an option skyrockets I roll it a few months down the road always after their next earnings date to be able to catch any gain up to the earnings day watching out for dividend dates quarterly rebalancing triple witching Fridays and then there s real life stuff as well If I can take a profit equal to my original basis then I have 100 gain and my original money back while also staying in the game with the future option I just rolled into if the market continues to go up If it goes down I ve already profited and got my original basis back so if I lose on the roll it s not life threatening to me Anyway I m exhausted and I love to read what I write to others because I have to live by it as well and still learn from it and sometimes I still fall down but I make sure I always get back up

2025-05-23,PLTR,comment,r/options,mtrc7f9,t3_1kqv3lo,Uniklady,5,,0.9989,,"So much to say here. First, major ‘Gambler’s mentality’ here and I make no apologies for it.  Gambling can be the stock markets, real estate, selling or buying insurance policies, casinos and more. So many things fall under that designation.  It is not bad to be a gambler, it just means you may be more aggressive vs conservative in your choices and take more risks.  It is very true that you can’t win if you’re not in the game and bigger risks bring bigger rewards and losses.

I have been trading stocks and options for over 35 years.  I have made 250k in a month and also lost $250k in a month before.  These past 3-5 months I lost 100k but instead of selling, I dollar cost averaged and bought more and have almost got it all back now in my options so I know the feeling of greed and not getting out before a great trade turns failed, many times and I will again.  I have also lost out by selling too quickly only to have the stock go on a run after I sold it.  But I made money and that was the point, I walked away with profit and the chance to trade another day.   You have to make hard decisions and remove ANY emotion from the equation.  In the end, it’s only about if your wins outdo your losses.  If you win 40% of the time but those wins equal more than your 60% of losses, that’s fine.   

It gets easier the longer you do it.  It’s like anything else you do over and over and get better at if you work hard at it.  Being a Gambler doesn’t make you a bad person nor does it automatically make you an addicted person.  I used to be in Advertising and loved what I did and always looked forward to Mondays to getting back to my work.  I was truly addicted to my work in a good way as the more I did the better I got and was a top 1% of a Fortune 500 company for over a decade.

But I am still in the trading and investment game and making my retirement from it.  I’m up till 1:30AM waiting for overnight markets to open to have an idea of tomorrows opening as well as getting up at 6am to plan anything I may need before market opens (on west coast).  Sunday nights I can’t wait for the market to open Monday like it’s Christmas Day every week!   Like you, I am obsessed with the market and all I learn from it.  But that is the key.  If you’re not learning about companies and how to make certain trades and what can happen on both sides of a trade, then you shouldn’t be trading.  The stock market is not a slot machine.  With a slot machine you have zero control, it’s all random.  With the stock market, if you focus on real companies making real profits and dividends then you have a chance to have some of your money grow for your future.  If you are just trading every day based on the news for the day or selling naked puts and calls and hoping and wishing…. You have zero control over what will happen and you will lose everything.

Think of where the country is going such as AI, Quantum Computing and Data Centers …. where are hedge funds and VC’s putting their money?  Then look up those companies and DO YOUR RESEARCH.  Major companies like Netflix, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Nividia, Palantir, Dominoes Pizza, Spotify, Shopify, Cava are just a few …. Think about the shoes you buy, the places you eat or shop, the subscriptions you have … are they good companies?  Will they be affected by price hikes from tariffs?  We don’t know if there will be any tariffs in the end because it’s a negotiation game and the pieces are always moving, so don’t bet on it cause you have no control over the moves.  Don’t bet for weeklies or daily trades cause you have no time for turnaround if things don’t go your way.  As a gambler, NEVER do margin, only trade with the money you own.  Do your research…. I can’t stress that enough - knowledge is power and the money will come if you are patient.

The stock market is not a get rich scheme.  If it does work that way for someone on a trade (meme stocks) trust me, they will lose it all within a week.  Check out the past charts of AMC and Game Stop, flew up fast and back down faster!  Don’t follow or trade something that is flying, find companies with long paths behind them.

Op, you sound like a really cool guy that has done what many others before you have done.  As some have said, it’s only money and you have time to make it back and more.  We all do the - “I could have, would have, should haves” for buying other things and trips not taken.  You gain nothing from swimming in guilt.  Get up and figure out how to make that money going forward, you are a smart guy. Don’t waste time on regrets, put them behind and focus forward.

Best advice from someone in the game a long time is to pick up your big boy pants and give yourself some money, not a lot, but enough to learn to trade small and build up your account.  If you’re going to do options, buy them for good companies with good earnings and instead of buying a lot, buy one close to ITM now but doesn’t expire for a year or two to give it time to grow.  Set alert’s for when it goes down 15, 20% and then decide either to get out or if it’s a normal downturn but a good company, then hang on. 

You can always paper trade as well to fine tune your skills.  But in the end, even all the analysts you see on TV make trading mistakes and the good ones admit it.

Sit down and write on paper what you want.  Do you want to grow a stock to 100k?  Then find companies with strong earnings and long time dividend increases each year and let it sit.  If you want to try options again, volatility makes them mover farther and faster but only buy one, ITM but longer expiration and watch it every day.  

The beauty I have learned about selling with modest gain vs a huge gain is that it will allow me to have my original basis back and then some extra money to buy again another day.  If I lose it all from being greedy, which I still am sometimes, I won’t be able to buy again.  A good way I do it is if an option skyrockets, I roll it a few months down the road, (always after their next earnings date to be able to catch any gain up to the earnings day) watching out for dividend dates, quarterly rebalancing triple witching Fridays … and then there’s real life stuff as well.

If it goes down, I’ve already profited and got my original basis back so if I lose on the roll, it’s not life threatening to me.

Anyway, I’m exhausted and I love to read what I write to others because I have to live by it as well and still learn from it and sometimes I still fall down, but I make sure I always get back up.

2.  The market always wants to go up…

I'm buying Google stock ahead of Apple's WWDC on June 9, betting there's a big AI announcement coming.

Google looks undervalued right now, about 17% off its recent highs despite posting strong earnings growth (+36% YoY). With a relatively cheap P/E of around 19, it feels like a good time to step in.

The real kicker: there's credible buzz that Apple might announce a partnership integrating Google's Gemini AI into iOS. Even Google's CEO Sundar Pichai has hinted at something big potentially coming by mid-2025. If true, that could drive Google shares sharply higher.

I'm planning to enter around $168–$172, targeting roughly $190 if the announcement hits.

This was definitely my most regarded trade to date (went WAY too big and way too short-dated obviously) but to be slightly fair to myself, that ""tax hit"" was ridiculous and unexpected. The market reaction was swift and immediate as soon as the market closed, WAY before the earnings call even actually started. Indicating it the drop was pretty much entirely due to the reported $1.05 EPS despite the claims I've seen others try to make that it wasn't.

However, the way Li and Zuckerberg handled explaining Meta's increased CapEx spend as if they are newly wed couple buying a big house that ""they will grow into"" when they have kids without ever effing explaining how all this AI bs will make them money in any very convincing manner did not help things and ensured the stock would keep falling.

No tears in the casino but this scared me off from ""betting"" on Amazon today and frankly probably going to go back to avoiding playing earnings calls all together. Just a completely unnecessary risk.

Nvidia valued at 5T and expected to bring in 250B calendar year 2026. Meta at 200B is not that bad. Margins are obviously not the same. 

  
Honestly Meta's a sleeper with a young founder CEO. He's making huge bets on innovation, which short term obviously sucks, but pays out huge in the future if it's good. Reality labs with the Meta display glasses will be huge in the future.

Nvidia valued at 5T and expected to bring in 250B calendar year 2026. Meta at 200B is not that bad. Margins are obviously not the same. 

  
Honestly Meta's a sleeper with a young founder CEO. He's making huge bets on innovation, which short term obviously sucks, but pays out huge in the future if it's good. Reality labs with the Meta display glasses will be huge in the future.

I spent some time as an options trader at a prop firm and we were using similar tool to optimize certain strategies we wanted to take. Built this for myself in my free time.

At a high level, it chooses a particular expiration date (5/30/2025 in the example above) and gets the option chain in real time using schwab's api for all stocks in the S&amp;P 500, then calculates the potential payoff and risk profile for all the contracts in the option chain.

I used it this week to sell a CC on NVDA, but in the example above you can can see that I can sort it by annualized premium, downside protection, etc. and choose the one that I want.

For the above calls I filtered by annualized premium above 50% and downside protection above 5%

Enjoyed making this and curious to hear your thoughts/suggestions what I can add to make it more robust. I currently am thinking to get like an ""optimal roll"" for the position I am in.

The second is **FEMY**, which focuses on female fertility products. Their product is already commercialized in Europe and Australia, and they’re now waiting for FDA approval in the U.S. Both stocks are currently trading under $1, and all major platforms rate them as ‘Strong Buy.’

That said, always do your own DD. Penny stocks, especially in biotech and pharma, are very risky. Personally, I believe both have legit products, now it’s all about execution. If things go well, their long-term upside could be huge.

One more thing to keep in mind: since they’re both under $1, there’s always a risk of delisting, and companies often do reverse splits to avoid that, which isn’t necessarily a good sign.

It depends. Risk level is 100% of the context when it comes to investing. If you want incredibly low risk, investing in safe corporate/treasury bonds might be your best bet. If you want the average level of risk, invest in various ETFs that track various things like the S&amp;P 500, Med./Small cap stocks, Emerging Markets, Foreign Companies, etc. If you're comfortable with a riskier option, blue-chip stocks are probably the way to go. There are higher risk levels you can go with, but, as you're a beginner, I don't even feel comfortable being the one to give you that information. Get comfortable with what you have now before you start trying to play with other things, or there's a high chance you'll lose most of your investment.  
As for specific tickers, I would personally choose different ETFs (for long-term, medium-risk, consistent growth)  
SPY, VOO, VWO, SPMO, SCHG, VTI, VUG, and anything else that is relatively close to this should be a pretty decent idea. You're very likely going to get decent growth, especially if you consistently invest over a long time (please do not try to time the market). 

All in all, it can be quite confusing at first; however, there are nearly infinite resources out there to help you accomplish your goals. I would advise to simply watch highly-viewed youtube videos on the topic, as they can be an excellent building block to get you where you need to be. There are even things like Robinhood's managed portfolio, which has (so far) generated solid returns for me with the little bit I threw in there out of curiosity.

Good luck to you. Remember, there is no ""short-cut"" to wealth. Consistency is key.",NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE It depends Risk level is 100 of the context when it comes to investing If you want incredibly low risk investing in safe corporate treasury bonds might be your best bet If you want the average level of risk invest in various ETFs that track various things like the S P 500 Med Small cap stocks Emerging Markets Foreign Companies etc If you re comfortable with a riskier option blue chip stocks are probably the way to go There are higher risk levels you can go with but as you re a beginner I don t even feel comfortable being the one to give you that information Get comfortable with what you have now before you start trying to play with other things or there s a high chance you ll lose most of your investment As for specific tickers I would personally choose different ETFs for long term medium risk consistent growth SPY VOO VWO SPMO SCHG VTI VUG and anything else that is relatively close to this should be a pretty decent idea You re very likely going to get decent growth especially if you consistently invest over a long time please do not try to time the market All in all it can be quite confusing at first however there are nearly infinite resources out there to help you accomplish your goals I would advise to simply watch highly viewed youtube videos on the topic as they can be an excellent building block to get you where you need to be There are even things like Robinhood s managed portfolio which has so far generated solid returns for me with the little bit I threw in there out of curiosity Good luck to you Remember there is no short cut to wealth Consistency is key

That right there's your problem...

You sold a contract saying that you would buy 100 shares of NVDA at $150 per share.  Someone else in the market holds that contract now and if NVDA falls below $150 before the expiration date, they can exercise that contract and you'll be required to buy 100 shares of NVDA for $15,000. 

You also purchased a contract to sell 100 shares of NVDA at $149 per share. This is how a spread limits risk.  If NVDA falls below $150 you'll be required to buy the shares, which you can then sell immediately at the market price to regain your cash. If it falls below $149, you also have a contract to sell those shares at $149, so the most you could lose if this position goes against you is $1 per share, or $100.  As long as you don't do anything stupid that is...

The premium for the contract you sold was more than the premium for the contract you bought. So you earned a credit when you opened this position.  That credit is the most money you will make on a credit spread. Your goal is that NVDA will stay above the strike price through expiration and both contracts will expire worthless.  Then you get to keep all of your premium.

But buying a contract is relatively safe, the worst that could happen if the market moves unexpectedly is you either lose the premium you paid for the contract, or if you don't have the cash to actually exercise the contract you might leave some potential profit on the table.

But selling a contract includes all of the risk. If that contract moves against you, you are in trouble. Selling puts is definitely safer than selling calls.  With a put you're defining your purchase price, and in this case as long as you have $15k in cash or margin in your account, getting assigned might end up just being a tough life lesson.  But for example, if you, as a retail investor, sold a bunch of GME calls back during the squeeze...your grandkids could be bankrupt already.

Two pieces of advice:  ALWAYS close your position before expiration

DON'T sell options until you understand what you're doing.  Once you do understand, start with puts on low price stocks so if you get assigned you can cover it with a few hundred dollars.

2025-07-24,AAPL,comment,r/RobinHood,n4yhbyo,t3_1m88uxt,ComprehensiveRub9299,1,,0.9942,,"You could clean up your portfolio a little. But it won’t affect your gains much. Just a nice Quality of Life change to make it easier to manage and monitor.

Owning AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA is redundant when you have SPY and VOO. Those tickers are so heavily weighted in the S&amp;P that your SPY and VOO tickers are already capturing them. 

The only reason id choose to own the individuals is if you are super bullish on one of them. So maybe you feel like AAPL is going to make a huge comeback with AI for example and their stock will pop. Then throw some portfolio share to that one (I’m currently doing this). But in general owning a bunch of Mag 7 is kind of pointless, you’re getting the same exposure through the ETFs but slightly more protected through ETFs because of better diversity and it’s less for you to manage you can just manage your ratio of portfolio to the ETF as a basket instead of a bunch of underlyings that are essentially doing the same thing. 

For that matter… why have VOO and SPY? These are literally the same thing. If you want to build up for options one day then go with SPY, otherwise convert it all to VOO. They are the same thing except SPY is charging you more for the privilege. 

I’d probably jump ship on Tesla if I were you. Plus like mentioned above Tesla’s already pulling you down in VOO and SPY no need to make it worse. Teslas going to have a hard road ahead for her next 8-12 months. I’m sure they will rebound and have some great gains next year, but I’d dip out now and buy later at the lower prices when it swings back up. No reason to go down with Elon on his ship.

Owning AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA is redundant when you have SPY and VOO. Those tickers are so heavily weighted in the S&amp;P that your SPY and VOO tickers are already capturing them. 

The only reason id choose to own the individuals is if you are super bullish on one of them. So maybe you feel like AAPL is going to make a huge comeback with AI for example and their stock will pop. Then throw some portfolio share to that one (I’m currently doing this). But in general owning a bunch of Mag 7 is kind of pointless, you’re getting the same exposure through the ETFs but slightly more protected through ETFs because of better diversity and it’s less for you to manage you can just manage your ratio of portfolio to the ETF as a basket instead of a bunch of underlyings that are essentially doing the same thing. 

For that matter… why have VOO and SPY? These are literally the same thing. If you want to build up for options one day then go with SPY, otherwise convert it all to VOO. They are the same thing except SPY is charging you more for the privilege. 

I’d probably jump ship on Tesla if I were you. Plus like mentioned above Tesla’s already pulling you down in VOO and SPY no need to make it worse. Teslas going to have a hard road ahead for her next 8-12 months. I’m sure they will rebound and have some great gains next year, but I’d dip out now and buy later at the lower prices when it swings back up. No reason to go down with Elon on his ship.

Do you think the fallout from Kimmel’s exit (and the perception of political/ideological pressure on entertainment companies) could meaningfully impact Disney’s stock in the near or medium term? Or is this just noise compared to Disney’s bigger drivers (parks, streaming, ESPN, etc.)?

I’m considering whether shorting Disney is a smart move here, but I’d like to hear other perspectives before making any decisions. Also, as of right now I hate the stock.

I'm curious if this is a money laundering operation based on what I've seen.  It's consistent with the Vietnamese nail salons that stay open for 10 years and have no customers.

From the exterior, I couldn't see much of a difference. It also made me wonder how active that office would be on a holiday weekend at 4 p.m.

If you have time to take another look during a busier week or at a more active time of day, that would be helpful. I'm fully in favor of transparency for investors, but I also think the timing of the visit—combined with factors like KULR’s quite recent move to Texas, the nature of sensitive technology, and the need to protect proprietary information might explain why operations aren't immediately visible.

1: Look at the obvious stuff that EVERYONE ELSE is looking at, and wait for the market to give you an opportunity. 

Example: Google basically all year until August. Had you simply ignored the bears and did some research you’d see the clear and unmistakable value. If you ONLY bought Google after liberation day, and kept buying every dip…you easily beat the market this year.

2: You gotta look where nowhere else is looking, find the value, and keep buying and wait for the market to recognize what you see. 


Example: Atari being up 50% in the final year of what will be a CLEARLY successful turn around. Mueller Industries being up line 30% - 40% this year since April with over a billion dollars of net cash on the balance sheet, debt free.

I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

Diamond hands only. 🦍💎🙌

A defense company that COULD become one of the new guard, aligned and partnered with Palantir and functioning as a holding company seeking out new tech for limitless AI battle space.

They have a few different drone platforms, unmanned surface vehicles and looks like they’re making a play for swarming underwater torpedo drones. 


*GPT write-up*

“RedCat Holdings (RCAT) is a small-cap defense technology company with the potential to deliver 100x returns over the next decade by capitalizing on one of the most transformative shifts in modern warfare: autonomous, AI-driven tactical drones. Its flagship platform, the Teal 2, has already earned a U.S. Army Program of Record (POR) designation for the Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program—an enormous validator that few small defense contractors ever achieve. This opens the door not just to initial unit sales, but to years of follow-on contracts, ecosystem lock-in, and integration into broader military and homeland security operations. With ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) needs exploding globally—especially in light of conflicts in Ukraine, the South China Sea, and border surveillance—RedCat is uniquely positioned with a Blue UAS-compliant, combat-ready product and growing relationships with AI and mission autonomy leaders like Palantir and Nearthlabs.

The pathway to a 100x stock price hinges on RedCat’s ability to scale into a full-spectrum defense integrator, similar to what Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman accomplished in past decades. If RedCat secures just a fraction of projected U.S. and allied drone procurement budgets—potentially exceeding $20B over the next ten years—and successfully expands into adjacent verticals like naval drones, autonomous ground vehicles, and AI battle management, the addressable market becomes vast. With its current market cap in the low tens of millions, even moderate success in becoming a key player in the U.S. military’s shift to autonomous systems could justify multibillion-dollar valuations. In essence, RedCat is a high-conviction asymmetric bet: if it fails, downside is limited due to its small size—but if it succeeds, it could become the Lockheed of the drone age.”",RedCat RCAT A defense company that COULD become one of the new guard aligned and partnered with Palantir and functioning as a holding company seeking out new tech for limitless AI battle space They have a few different drone platforms unmanned surface vehicles and looks like they re making a play for swarming underwater torpedo drones GPT write up RedCat Holdings RCAT is a small cap defense technology company with the potential to deliver 100x returns over the next decade by capitalizing on one of the most transformative shifts in modern warfare autonomous AI driven tactical drones Its flagship platform the Teal 2 has already earned a U S Army Program of Record POR designation for the Short Range Reconnaissance SRR program an enormous validator that few small defense contractors ever achieve This opens the door not just to initial unit sales but to years of follow on contracts ecosystem lock in and integration into broader military and homeland security operations With ISR intelligence surveillance reconnaissance needs exploding globally especially in light of conflicts in Ukraine the South China Sea and border surveillance RedCat is uniquely positioned with a Blue UAS compliant combat ready product and growing relationships with AI and mission autonomy leaders like Palantir and Nearthlabs The pathway to a 100x stock price hinges on RedCat s ability to scale into a full spectrum defense integrator similar to what Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman accomplished in past decades If RedCat secures just a fraction of projected U S and allied drone procurement budgets potentially exceeding $20B over the next ten years and successfully expands into adjacent verticals like naval drones autonomous ground vehicles and AI battle management the addressable market becomes vast With its current market cap in the low tens of millions even moderate success in becoming a key player in the U S military s shift to autonomous systems could justify multibillion dollar valuations In essence RedCat is a high conviction asymmetric bet if it fails downside is limited due to its small size but if it succeeds it could become the Lockheed of the drone age

I'm also the guy that recommended on my X profile to invest in CRML when it was at $1/share (it's almost at $30/share now) and in UAMY at $2/share (it's $17/share now).

And before that, many others including $TSLA back in 2017 and Bitcoin when it was at $300. I can prove all that.

I'm forced to write this because I don't want to associate my posts to a lot of pump&amp;dump I'm seeing here.

Now that hopefully I clarified that, I want to introduce all of you to a stock that is very under the radar but with massive potential. I like these kind of stocks because their price appreciation is tied to other stocks in the same sector, so basically they're arbitrage opportunities (valuation gap has to close).

I copy here the same post I made on my X account:

$HOND Detailed due diligence and why I believe it's a 7X (700%) multibagger opportunity here

A lot of people are invested in quantum stocks, the $CCCX SPAC or $OKLO and I, myself, recently entered $CCCX with roughly 80K of my money and it's been a good investment and I believe it will continue to go up because it has to close the valuation gap with the other quantum companies.

Now, calculating the implied market cap of the company that merge with the SPAC isn't really easy and it takes a lot of time because we have to account for the pro forma ownership (SPAC shareholders %, company that merge with the SPAC %, PIPE%, Sponsor shares %, Equity from Convertible Debt, ecc) and the redemption rates during the De-SPAC process.

You can't just take the $CCCX market cap right now and say Infleqtion implied market cap is that because it's not. And it's also not the pre-money valuation. To value a SPAC you need to do a lot of DD and many people are either too lazy or just don't know how to do these calculations. In another post I did the calculation for $CCCX and how much the share price has to rise to match the current market cap of $RGTI to close the valuation gap.

Now, let me talk about another SPAC that will have to rise to close the valuation gap with $OKLO. As you all know $OKLO is an advanced nuclear energy/clean tech startup with the goal to design and deploy next generation fission reactors (small modular) that are safer, more compact, and more efficient than traditional large nuclear plants.  
The current market cap is $26.5 billion.

Terrestrial Energy is a company that’s developing Generation IV nuclear reactor technology, specifically a molten salt reactor design.  
Their flagship design is called the Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR).  
The IMSR is a small modular reactor (SMR) that uses molten salt as both the fuel medium (in liquid form) and coolant.  
They're about to go public through a SPAC named $HOND.

Now, without going into too much detail, the TAM for $HOND is $1.2 trillion globally. The TAM for $OKLO is $600-700 billion globally. So $HOND TAM is roughly double the $OKLO TAM.  
But their market cap greatly differ because Terrestrial Energy hasn't benefited from the massive rally that nuclear stocks benefited from as it was still private.  
So instead of being valued $25.6 billion, the pro forma market cap with the SPAC was just $1.3 billion!!  
Now $HOND has a market cap of $675 million. Again, don't make the amateur mistake of taking the SPAC market cap as the implied market cap of Terrestrial Energy.  
We have to account for the Pro Forma Ownership and do all the calculations (Terrestrial Rollover Equity: 71.2%, Public Shareholders of the SPAC: 17.7%, PIPE: 3.8%, Sponsor Shares: 4.4%, Equity from Convertible Debt: 2.9%).

  
We also have to account for redemptions but since $HOND stock price is now around $23.70, logic says there will be very few redemptions. But let's say it will be 20-25% to stay conservative.  
Accounting for all that it gives us an implied market cap of Terrestrial Energy (at the current $HOND market cap) of $4.05 billion (let's say $4 billion).

So, even if we assume we should have the same market cap as $OKLO (despite having double the TAM), we should rise almost 7X from here to close the valuation gap and this doesn't even take into consideration further upside movements in $OKLO.

So $HOND now trades at around $23/share and will have to reach at least $150/share to close the valuation gap with $OKLO.

A 7x multibagger!!

And $HOND is a very under the radar stock, very few people are aware it even exists. In my opinion it's one of the very best asymmetric opportunities in the market right now.",$HOND the stock you never heard about that can rise 700 from here DD So first of all I m not a pump dump guy I was the guy that gave here the DD about AMPX I m also the guy that recommended on my X profile to invest in CRML when it was at $1 share it s almost at $30 share now and in UAMY at $2 share it s $17 share now And before that many others including $TSLA back in 2017 and Bitcoin when it was at $300 I can prove all that I m forced to write this because I don t want to associate my posts to a lot of pump dump I m seeing here Now that hopefully I clarified that I want to introduce all of you to a stock that is very under the radar but with massive potential I like these kind of stocks because their price appreciation is tied to other stocks in the same sector so basically they re arbitrage opportunities valuation gap has to close I copy here the same post I made on my X account $HOND Detailed due diligence and why I believe it s a 7X 700 multibagger opportunity here A lot of people are invested in quantum stocks the $CCCX SPAC or $OKLO and I myself recently entered $CCCX with roughly 80K of my money and it s been a good investment and I believe it will continue to go up because it has to close the valuation gap with the other quantum companies Now calculating the implied market cap of the company that merge with the SPAC isn t really easy and it takes a lot of time because we have to account for the pro forma ownership SPAC shareholders company that merge with the SPAC PIPE Sponsor shares Equity from Convertible Debt ecc and the redemption rates during the De SPAC process You can t just take the $CCCX market cap right now and say Infleqtion implied market cap is that because it s not And it s also not the pre money valuation To value a SPAC you need to do a lot of DD and many people are either too lazy or just don t know how to do these calculations In another post I did the calculation for $CCCX and how much the share price has to rise to match the current market cap of $RGTI to close the valuation gap Now let me talk about another SPAC that will have to rise to close the valuation gap with $OKLO As you all know $OKLO is an advanced nuclear energy clean tech startup with the goal to design and deploy next generation fission reactors small modular that are safer more compact and more efficient than traditional large nuclear plants The current market cap is $26 5 billion Terrestrial Energy is a company that s developing Generation IV nuclear reactor technology specifically a molten salt reactor design Their flagship design is called the Integral Molten Salt Reactor IMSR The IMSR is a small modular reactor SMR that uses molten salt as both the fuel medium in liquid form and coolant They re about to go public through a SPAC named $HOND Now without going into too much detail the TAM for $HOND is $1 2 trillion globally The TAM for $OKLO is $600 700 billion globally So $HOND TAM is roughly double the $OKLO TAM But their market cap greatly differ because Terrestrial Energy hasn t benefited from the massive rally that nuclear stocks benefited from as it was still private So instead of being valued $25 6 billion the pro forma market cap with the SPAC was just $1 3 billion Now $HOND has a market cap of $675 million Again don t make the amateur mistake of taking the SPAC market cap as the implied market cap of Terrestrial Energy We have to account for the Pro Forma Ownership and do all the calculations Terrestrial Rollover Equity 71 2 Public Shareholders of the SPAC 17 7 PIPE 3 8 Sponsor Shares 4 4 Equity from Convertible Debt 2 9 We also have to account for redemptions but since $HOND stock price is now around $23 70 logic says there will be very few redemptions But let s say it will be 20 25 to stay conservative Accounting for all that it gives us an implied market cap of Terrestrial Energy at the current $HOND market cap of $4 05 billion let s say $4 billion So even if we assume we should have the same market cap as $OKLO despite having double the TAM we should rise almost 7X from here to close the valuation gap and this doesn t even take into consideration further upside movements in $OKLO So $HOND now trades at around $23 share and will have to reach at least $150 share to close the valuation gap with $OKLO A 7x multibagger And $HOND is a very under the radar stock very few people are aware it even exists In my opinion it s one of the very best asymmetric opportunities in the market right now

Alright degenerates, listen up...

GME is doing its thing again — sitting on nearly 19% short interest, low float, and that sweet 5-day-to-cover setup. The OG squeeze is BACK and it’s looking juicier than ever. If you ain’t watching it, you’re sleeping.

But here’s the thing… it’s not just GME anymore.

The squeeze list is STACKED rn:

🚀 Kohl’s (KSS) – Bruh... 50% short interest?? That’s criminal. It jumped like 40% yesterday. That wasn’t a bounce. That was a warning shot.

🚀 Opendoor (OPEN) – Up 120% intraday, settled around +43%. Volume is INSANE. Short float ~22%. This thing is turning into a mini GME.

🚀 Rocket (RKT) – 30% short interest. Yes, 30%. Ain’t no coincidence it's spiking again.

🚀 Wayfair (W), Etsy (ETSY), Rivian (RIVN) – All chilling in the 21–23% short range. Meme stock energy is flowing through their veins.

🚀 Birkenstock (BIRK) – Almost 20% short float. Who tf shorted sandals lmao.

🚀 Moderna (MRNA) – High short buzz. Big pharma gets no love from the apes, apparently.

Alright degenerates, listen up...

GME is doing its thing again — sitting on nearly 19% short interest, low float, and that sweet 5-day-to-cover setup. The OG squeeze is BACK and it’s looking juicier than ever. If you ain’t watching it, you’re sleeping.

But here’s the thing… it’s not just GME anymore.

The squeeze list is STACKED rn:

🚀 Kohl’s (KSS) – Bruh... 50% short interest?? That’s criminal. It jumped like 40% yesterday. That wasn’t a bounce. That was a warning shot.

🚀 Opendoor (OPEN) – Up 120% intraday, settled around +43%. Volume is INSANE. Short float ~22%. This thing is turning into a mini GME.

🚀 Rocket (RKT) – 30% short interest. Yes, 30%. Ain’t no coincidence it's spiking again.

🚀 Wayfair (W), Etsy (ETSY), Rivian (RIVN) – All chilling in the 21–23% short range. Meme stock energy is flowing through their veins.

🚀 Birkenstock (BIRK) – Almost 20% short float. Who tf shorted sandals lmao.

🚀 Moderna (MRNA) – High short buzz. Big pharma gets no love from the apes, apparently.

🚀 Rigetti (RGTI) &amp; D-Wave (DWQ) – Quantum memes incoming 🧠✨

This is straight-up squeeze season. The algo-boys can’t plug every hole in the dam.

GME is the rallying cry, but don’t sleep on the side quests — some of these are literally breaking circuit halts from raw buying pressure.

I jumped in 43,000 shares with a 2.38 average for 6 reasons. Initially, I was hesitant for the past 2 days, worried about the hype

1. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠The Walmart deal alone is enormous, which will propel the stock to easily 10$.
2. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠The volume is insane and almost 1.5 billion and 45 minutes more to go before closing. Momentum will squeeze the shorts out.
3. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Earnings in 14 days have all the hallmarks of big news, including Walmart, and who knows, other big retailers to follow.
4. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠The cost-effective economy burger product seems catchy for Walmart or any retailer's shoppers.
5. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠The vegan movement is growing rapidly every year.
6. ⁠Just imagine BYND expands worldwide apart from US market. There is a big potential.

Will hold till earnings to digest and make the decision.

2025-09-08,PLTR,comment,r/Daytrading,nd31gjv,t3_1nbfv7f,Ironsidedimwit,3,,0.9017,,"Damn bro, sending the love and success in life your way. My story is not to dissimilar. Like others have said I worked a hard, time consuming job for many years. Lived a nice life with my family. 3 holidays a year, treats whenever etc. I then came across trading in 2020. I was obsessed with the idea of being able to make what I made in a day in a few hours and then having the whole day to enjoy with my kids. I like yourself built a little cushion but stupidly jumped from my job to go full time on the screens way wayyy too early. Looking back I would have stayed in full time employment and just carried on building. When I jumped it felt brilliant, I got to take my kids to school I got to pick them up, we could go and do whatever we wanted. Little did I know the mental aspect of trading at the time. Once my “edge”
Didn’t work and I started to have bigger and bigger red days.. the time with my family disappeared. I would sit infront of the screens from pre market to after market. The mood swings to my family, the disassociation was extreme. In the moment which was probably a couple of years of the pain cycle of rinse and repeat mistakes I never realised what I was doing to my family. At one point in 2022 I went back to work but I still had that dream of being “ financially free” I worked for around a year before building another stake to go again. This time my first month was 🚀 I thought all that pain was worth it.. again looking back now I had no control of myself or emotions I thought it was skill
But it was luck after luck. My risk was out the window as soon as I took a few losers my size was too big for my account. It is only now I can say out loud I was gambling. Like iron mike said “everyone’s got a plan before they get punched in the face” the damage I have done to myself and my family from trading will probably never be reversible. I over leveraged got into debt and virtually gambled my accounts away and took it out on my family. I’m 3 months away from the screens. I have started to pay back my debts. I have moved on to making a living in a different sector. Question is do I think about making a living from the markets still? I’d be lying if I said no. I still do believe I can get back to the screens and prove to myself I can control my emotions I can turn off I can adhere to my plan, my plan outweighs my feelings I can create that time with my family again. I may be delusional I don’t know. The only shining light of my story is I started investing long term heavily when I started day trading all my positions are in great profit. PLTR is my strongest 750% return as of today! DCA long term is probably the safest way to make money in the markets. Clearly people are successful at day trading, don’t get me wrong there are many many scammers out there that portray a lifestyle which makes you think “ damn if they can get it I can “ but in reality most of there money is made from scamming people into signals, courses, or mentorship’s.

Although, in my case, the laptop screen only serves to show my reminders, finder, and a terminal window, and, being honest, I could work just as well with just my MacBook and one extra screen.

Depending on what one is working on, I believe that at least one extra screen makes sense to boost productivity. Considering the following activities, for example:

\- Development: One screen to write the code, one to preview how it looks in the running application  
\- Trading: One screen to analyze the chart, one to manage positions.  
\- Video editing: One screen to edit, one to preview the video.

When I learned to trade the people around me told me to ignore candlestick patters and they were often the butt of a joke, like some guy on Amazon self publishing his book on candlestick patterns who’s never traded successfully in his life sort of thing… so I never used them in my trading strategies.
That being said, if something has even a 50% occurrence it can be exploited through good trade management and it can be profitable. It won’t be profitable if you try to take 1:1 or another fixed ratio, but if you trail stops based off time and price once a month or every other month you’ll get a ripper that ends up going out to 1:10 or more. The older guys would call this letting the market do the lifting.

The difference between winning and losing traders isn't the strategy – it's how they handle the exact same loss.



\&gt; ❌ One gives up after a loss  

\&gt; ❌ One overtrades to ""win it back""  

\&gt; ✅ One takes a break, re-evaluates, waits for a real edge – and wins later



That third mindset is rare. But it’s trainable.



After 36 months grinding from €32 starting capital, I realized that the game is 80% emotional regulation, 20% execution.

2025-07-27,GOOG,comment,r/Daytrading,n5d024m,t3_1m9u16j,-JKR,35,,0.9991,,"Hello everyone, I really appreciate the positive feedback!   Also, I feel I get more credit than I really deserved here. I’m really hesitant to give out my strategy not because it’s a secret, but because I don’t feel it’s something to relay on. It is my first week but in no means do I even feel closely proficient at this or that I can maintain this momentum without loss soon. I want to believe that it was all “controlled” luck and a bit of analytical mindset. That being said, I want to add a comment here to address your questions. 

1. What platform for I use?
I was using vanguard but quickly learned that I cannot do day trading there, it is more for long term trading making it impossible to react to quick change among lack of features.

2. What is my strategy?
Well I am relatively new to this whole thing, I’ve been watching the market, reading about how people conduct their trades and 1-3 YouTube videos at most since they tend to want to shove advertisements down your throat. 

Now, to paint a picture. I started looking at the top volume movers for the day, honestly at first I had no idea what heavy volume looked like but wanted to understand the relationship of the volume to the speed in which the price changes. At first I saw a couple stocks that were moving and honestly it seemed that it was related to Reddit hype stocks, low price under $1 1000%+ profits. I felt that was too risky learning about how dodge coin blew up and ended up hitting with FOMO in the behind and so I didn’t wanted to be in that same boat.

I started using chatgpt, to help me find small stocks with high volatility in order to compare what I am seen. Keep in mind chatgpt can be good and bad. To tell the truth, my day 1 loss was too dependent on chatgpt so resulted I a small loss nonetheless. I cannot talk bad about this tool, as it gave me good hints, things like apply for Book Order 2, which turned out to be extremely helpful in understand how quickly prices would drop or potentially go up. It also gave me a glance into seen when people build walls, wanting to keep the price low/high. 

Day one was indeed a financial loss but a knowledge profit. Through the time I payed attention to how the price of the stocks moved, the patterns that it took before a spike and relative time to when it would happen. I also lurked in the feeds, what did people say, it looked nothing more than an attempt to persuade people to go one way or the other but helped me make sense of some price changes. 

Moving forward, I watched at a [video](https://youtu.be/5X_ZcifasBg?si=oUaXHKY4K8eSZ8eN) by Ross Cameron on how to look for stocks that may give profits. 
I used the pattern strategy he talked about and compare it to stocks which had high volume movement on previous days as well as stocks that had dipped from over $1 down to $.0XXX this helped me mentally prepare what bottom is and potential upwards gain, as we know through physics class, for every action there is a equal and opposite reaction. And with that foolish thinking I placed my first couple bets and used the fundamentals I learned to hope for a profit. I monitored the price and waited for the same patterns. Big struggle at a specific place, followed by a couple walls in price bids and asks but ultimately seen a slow climb up to spikes, missed most of the spikes, as I wasn’t sure when they’ll stop going up and I didn’t want to miss on profits, quickly learned to take the wins where I could and newton’s 3rd law humble me right away. Luckily most dips were not too bad that I saw a potential for comeback and held enough to take a profit. 

Rinse and repeat, keep my wins even if they seem small and we ended up with a gain profit in a daily. I did plenty of mistakes that were related to greed. I sold at a really nice profit, price kept climbing up so I repurchased right before the drop… thankfully prices came back up and I managed to cut my big profit into a small profit still staying positive on the day. 

Other mistakes were to get too emotional when price drops down. I sold too early to conserved losses when the pattern looked like it may bounce back still. I will say most of my losses have been due to lack of keeping my emotions in check. 

I hope this helps anyone, or at least a fun story of a brand new trader that could be in the road for disaster itself. There probably is a lot more that I look at, things I take into account in the moment while I’m doing trades but the important thing for me was to keep a level head and read the charts in how they are moving… I would agree that I invested much more time than I really wanted to but it resulted in a green week. I believe my P&amp;L percentage is +36.62% which gain me much more than when I put stocks in the S&amp;P 500 for several months and let them sit, I only gain $100.

I lost all my personal progress I made with day trading as in inner self work of managing emotions, journaling, reviewing trades etc. I was no longer able to come home from work at a reasonable time to then be on my screens til bedtime… anytime I sat down to trade I was rushed &amp; angry because I had just had the recent realization back in April that trading could replace my job with time… I tried to pretend it didn’t happen but I absolutely let it go to my head making all that money, &amp; my inner voice was telling me to step away while I still had a cash account of 20k but I knew I would have to quit my job because it became unsustainable, so I would force trading on myself and lose money everyday I showed up.

It wasnt my fault that I had to quit my job and Amazon screwed it all up, but it was my fault for not stepping back and accounting for my emotional state from external forces in life.

Sorry for the long reply, but your message hit a nerve with me that I could relate to… at one point I was feeling emotions I can’t even describe because of how large my account became &amp; the next because I had lost my center I was in shambles.

I’m doing okay now that I’ve quit my job and can finally see what had happened clearly, and luckily only lost a severe amount of my profits &amp; not my money I put in originally… still.

But as I continue to pursue trading with passion again, I’m also pursuing a job in law enforcement so I can have that stability in the future with a job. It is very important to have a job as your back bone in my eyes.",I just hit my peak in my cash account back in April 35k over three months of trading most coming from a swing trade with $GLD largest amount I ve ever had in my life actually Same feeling as you described Be very careful here please maybe even take a break from trading from what your emotional state is recalibrate realize it s money you ve earned and deserve because it does absolutely feel unreal I blew my account up 1 I never had any risk management skills for anything over the 7 to 15k I usually had in my brokerage account 2 my job got totally screwed up I was a private contractor with usps and Amazon basically came in and made my job next to impossible and with no degree enjoyment anymore I lost all my personal progress I made with day trading as in inner self work of managing emotions journaling reviewing trades etc I was no longer able to come home from work at a reasonable time to then be on my screens til bedtime anytime I sat down to trade I was rushed angry because I had just had the recent realization back in April that trading could replace my job with time I tried to pretend it didn t happen but I absolutely let it go to my head making all that money my inner voice was telling me to step away while I still had a cash account of 20k but I knew I would have to quit my job because it became unsustainable so I would force trading on myself and lose money everyday I showed up It wasnt my fault that I had to quit my job and Amazon screwed it all up but it was my fault for not stepping back and accounting for my emotional state from external forces in life Sorry for the long reply but your message hit a nerve with me that I could relate to at one point I was feeling emotions I can t even describe because of how large my account became the next because I had lost my center I was in shambles I m doing okay now that I ve quit my job and can finally see what had happened clearly and luckily only lost a severe amount of my profits not my money I put in originally still But as I continue to pursue trading with passion again I m also pursuing a job in law enforcement so I can have that stability in the future with a job It is very important to have a job as your back bone in my eyes
2025-10-27,AMZN,post,r/TechStocks,1ohb4qo,,SitshaIom,8,0.0,0.998,GPUS (Hyperscale Data Inc) - Undervalued AI/HPC infrastructure microcap,"Hey folks - there’s way too little serious DD on truly undervalued names right now. The market keeps chasing the same five meme tickers while real businesses get ignored. Here’s one of those: **GPUS (Hyperscale Data Inc)** \- a former bitcoin miner that’s just completed its **AI pivot** and is building actual infrastructure for AI/HPC hosting. Remember where you heard it first.

GPUS comes from the mining world, which already has exactly what AI customers are fighting over: **cheap power, cooling, and big data halls**. Instead of mining bitcoin, they’re now using the same infrastructure to **host GPU servers for AI workloads**. This is not “AI on a PowerPoint” - they’ve **already installed NVIDIA GPUs** and built a base for **commercial AI hosting**. And while peers have been **re-rated** on news and contracts, GPUS is still largely overlooked - with the same setup, the same tailwind, and a far smaller valuation.

# Background

The AI market is exploding, and demand for GPU capacity is massive. But the hyperscalers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) are still **quarters away** from turning on their next waves of campuses. Meanwhile, AI companies need **power, cooling, and ready-made space right now**. That opens a unique window for operators who already have the infrastructure in place.

GPUS originated in bitcoin mining but has clearly pivoted to **AI/HPC infrastructure**. The company owns a **57,000 m² data center campus in Michigan** (hyperscale-size). They currently run \~**30 MW**, with plans to scale to **340 MW** via the local grid and gas backup. In **March**, GPUS installed its first **NVIDIA GPUs** for a Silicon Valley–based cloud customer; the rollout went well and the engagement **expanded in September**. Bottom line: they can deliver AI hosting **today**, not “in three years when the hyperscalers finish their new builds.”

The entire sector is shifting: **bitcoin miners are converting into AI infrastructure** because **GPU hosting yields far better margins** than mining. This is not a blip - it’s the start of a multi-year transition where operators sign **5–10 year AI contracts** and become the backbone of the new compute economy.

Next up, GPUS’s subsidiary **Alliance Cloud Services** plans to launch its own **GPU cloud (H100/B200/B300)** in **H1 2026**, unlocking recurring revenue via hourly billing - think a “mini-CoreWeave,” but at a **microcap** valuation.

# Financial position &amp; cash

They’re also building a **digital asset treasury** (bitcoin) of roughly **$60M** (held + committed purchases). For a microcap that’s meaningful - giving them **capex flexibility** and financing muscle without immediate dilution. In **October**, GPUS also **regained NYSE American compliance**, meaning the “.BC” flag is removed - important for screens and institutions. This is often where sentiment begins to turn and likely why they’ve been “under the radar” recently.

# Why it’s undervalued

The market is pricing GPUS as if the business barely exists, despite the company:

* Having a **paying customer** and growing capacity
* Owning a **ready campus** with **power + cooling**
* Planning a **commercial GPU cloud**
* **Regaining listing compliance**
* Operating in a **structurally growing AI/HPC market**

In microcaps, it often takes just **one additional customer** to move the needle: **utilization → revenue → multiple** can shift quickly.

# Peers

GPUS is effectively the **same type of story** as **CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR** \- former bitcoin miners rotating into **AI infrastructure**. That’s exactly the pivot the market has already started to **reward aggressively**. Over the past months, these names have **re-rated** as they moved from crypto operations to **building and leasing AI data halls**:

* **CIFR \~+600%** (last six months)
* **APLD \~+600%** (same period)
* **HUT8 \~+270%** (same period)
* **WULF \~+350%** (same period), including **+43% in a single day** on a Google-backed AI deal (\~$3.7B over 10 years)
* **IREN \~+900%** (same period)
* **BTDR** got target hikes after its AI pivot and is up **\~130% in six months**

Same pattern every time: **contracts → utilization → multiple expansion**. GPUS hasn’t been re-rated yet - but it’s building into **the same demand**.

Also compare with **Equinix (EQIX)** / **Digital Realty (DLR)** at **$60–80B** market caps - stable giants with low multiple torque. GPUS is a baby in the same ecosystem - **same tailwinds,** far higher upside **per MW/customer.**

# Short-squeeze potential

Estimated **short interest \~24% of float** and rising month-over-month. **Borrow fees** are elevated. If sentiment turns and volume fades, **days-to-cover** can spike. In other words, there’s fuel for a technical squeeze **if** positive news hits (customer, MWs, cloud launch milestones).

# Catalysts

* Public launch of the **GPU cloud (H1 ’26)** with hourly pricing + first named customers
* **Michigan power build-out** (LOAs, timeline, gas track)
* Ongoing guidance consistent with spring signals (**$25M Q1 revenue; $115–125M full-year guidance**)
* Updates on the **DAT/bitcoin treasury** \- financing flexibility into expansion

# Cleanup &amp; compliance

* **Leadership**: CEO is **William B. Horne**. Founder/executive chairman **Milton “Todd” Ault III** has a **history including a 2016–2021 SEC matter**. In **2025**, the company said **Ault intends to step down from officer roles** after a planned divestiture; **Horne remains CEO and becomes Chairman**, with Ault **staying on the board**. Net-net: governance optics **improving**, operational control increasingly consolidated under Horne.
* **Listing**: The company previously fell out of **NYSE American compliance** (e.g., equity thresholds), but as of **October 2025** it **regained full compliance** and the “.BC” tag is being **removed**. That’s exactly the kind of cleanup institutions like to see - it widens the potential buyer base and removes a headline overhang.
* **Preferred shares (D/E)**: Yes, there are **Series D/E preferreds** with **fixed coupons** (senior to common). That’s **normal** in power/datacenter/infra builds. These instruments often help scale **without** hammering common with constant secondaries.

(If anything, the combo of operational progress + compliance regained + rational financing tools is exactly how microcaps graduate into **credible re-rates**.)

# TL;DR

1. Peers (CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR) have already re-rated hard on AI contracts - several up triple digits. **GPUS hasn’t re-rated yet.**
2. In a microcap, **one new customer** can move revenue materially - and the multiple even more.
3. The **short setup** means any good news can be **amplified**.

The market is currently pricing in “nothing happens.” But **if** GPUS takes *one more step* \- a new customer, new MWs, or the GPU cloud going live - the **re-pricing writes itself**. If you want to **front-run the microcap AI re-rating**, GPUS is a classic **asymmetric bet**: limited downside, outsized upside.

In **October**, GPUS also **regained NYSE American compliance**, meaning the “.BC” flag is removed - important for screens and institutions. This is often where sentiment begins to turn and likely why they’ve been “under the radar” recently.

# Why it’s undervalued

The market is pricing GPUS as if the business barely exists, despite the company:

* Having a **paying customer** and growing capacity
* Owning a **ready campus** with **power + cooling**
* Planning a **commercial GPU cloud**
* **Regaining listing compliance**
* Operating in a **structurally growing AI/HPC market**

In microcaps, it often takes just **one additional customer** to move the needle: **utilization → revenue → multiple** can shift quickly.

# Peers

GPUS is effectively the **same type of story** as **CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR** \- former bitcoin miners rotating into **AI infrastructure**. That’s exactly the pivot the market has already started to **reward aggressively**. Over the past months, these names have **re-rated** as they moved from crypto operations to **building and leasing AI data halls**:

* **CIFR \~+600%** (last six months)
* **APLD \~+600%** (same period)
* **HUT8 \~+270%** (same period)
* **WULF \~+350%** (same period), including **+43% in a single day** on a Google-backed AI deal (\~$3.7B over 10 years)
* **IREN \~+900%** (same period)
* **BTDR** got target hikes after its AI pivot and is up **\~130% in six months**

Same pattern every time: **contracts → utilization → multiple expansion**. GPUS hasn’t been re-rated yet - but it’s building into **the same demand**.

Also compare with **Equinix (EQIX)** / **Digital Realty (DLR)** at **$60–80B** market caps - stable giants with low multiple torque. GPUS is a baby in the same ecosystem - **same tailwinds,** far higher upside **per MW/customer.**

# Short-squeeze potential

Estimated **short interest \~24% of float** and rising month-over-month. **Borrow fees** are elevated. If sentiment turns and volume fades, **days-to-cover** can spike. In other words, there’s fuel for a technical squeeze **if** positive news hits (customer, MWs, cloud launch milestones).

# Catalysts

* Public launch of the **GPU cloud (H1 ’26)** with hourly pricing + first named customers
* **Michigan power build-out** (LOAs, timeline, gas track)
* Ongoing guidance consistent with spring signals (**$25M Q1 revenue; $115–125M full-year guidance**)
* Updates on the **DAT/bitcoin treasury** \- financing flexibility into expansion

# Cleanup &amp; compliance

* **Leadership**: CEO is **William B. Horne**. Founder/executive chairman **Milton “Todd” Ault III** has a **history including a 2016–2021 SEC matter**. In **2025**, the company said **Ault intends to step down from officer roles** after a planned divestiture; **Horne remains CEO and becomes Chairman**, with Ault **staying on the board**. Net-net: governance optics **improving**, operational control increasingly consolidated under Horne.
* **Listing**: The company previously fell out of **NYSE American compliance** (e.g., equity thresholds), but as of **October 2025** it **regained full compliance** and the “.BC” tag is being **removed**. That’s exactly the kind of cleanup institutions like to see - it widens the potential buyer base and removes a headline overhang.
* **Preferred shares (D/E)**: Yes, there are **Series D/E preferreds** with **fixed coupons** (senior to common). That’s **normal** in power/datacenter/infra builds. These instruments often help scale **without** hammering common with constant secondaries.

(If anything, the combo of operational progress + compliance regained + rational financing tools is exactly how microcaps graduate into **credible re-rates**.)

# TL;DR

1. Peers (CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR) have already re-rated hard on AI contracts - several up triple digits. **GPUS hasn’t re-rated yet.**
2. In a microcap, **one new customer** can move revenue materially - and the multiple even more.
3. The **short setup** means any good news can be **amplified**.

The market is currently pricing in “nothing happens.” But **if** GPUS takes *one more step* \- a new customer, new MWs, or the GPU cloud going live - the **re-pricing writes itself**. If you want to **front-run the microcap AI re-rating**, GPUS is a classic **asymmetric bet**: limited downside, outsized upside.

2025-10-27,NVDA,post,r/TechStocks,1ohb4qo,,SitshaIom,8,0.0,0.998,GPUS (Hyperscale Data Inc) - Undervalued AI/HPC infrastructure microcap,"Hey folks - there’s way too little serious DD on truly undervalued names right now. The market keeps chasing the same five meme tickers while real businesses get ignored. Here’s one of those: **GPUS (Hyperscale Data Inc)** \- a former bitcoin miner that’s just completed its **AI pivot** and is building actual infrastructure for AI/HPC hosting. Remember where you heard it first.

GPUS comes from the mining world, which already has exactly what AI customers are fighting over: **cheap power, cooling, and big data halls**. Instead of mining bitcoin, they’re now using the same infrastructure to **host GPU servers for AI workloads**. This is not “AI on a PowerPoint” - they’ve **already installed NVIDIA GPUs** and built a base for **commercial AI hosting**. And while peers have been **re-rated** on news and contracts, GPUS is still largely overlooked - with the same setup, the same tailwind, and a far smaller valuation.

# Background

The AI market is exploding, and demand for GPU capacity is massive. But the hyperscalers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) are still **quarters away** from turning on their next waves of campuses. Meanwhile, AI companies need **power, cooling, and ready-made space right now**. That opens a unique window for operators who already have the infrastructure in place.

GPUS originated in bitcoin mining but has clearly pivoted to **AI/HPC infrastructure**. The company owns a **57,000 m² data center campus in Michigan** (hyperscale-size). They currently run \~**30 MW**, with plans to scale to **340 MW** via the local grid and gas backup. In **March**, GPUS installed its first **NVIDIA GPUs** for a Silicon Valley–based cloud customer; the rollout went well and the engagement **expanded in September**. Bottom line: they can deliver AI hosting **today**, not “in three years when the hyperscalers finish their new builds.”

The entire sector is shifting: **bitcoin miners are converting into AI infrastructure** because **GPU hosting yields far better margins** than mining. This is not a blip - it’s the start of a multi-year transition where operators sign **5–10 year AI contracts** and become the backbone of the new compute economy.

Next up, GPUS’s subsidiary **Alliance Cloud Services** plans to launch its own **GPU cloud (H100/B200/B300)** in **H1 2026**, unlocking recurring revenue via hourly billing - think a “mini-CoreWeave,” but at a **microcap** valuation.

# Financial position &amp; cash

They’re also building a **digital asset treasury** (bitcoin) of roughly **$60M** (held + committed purchases). For a microcap that’s meaningful - giving them **capex flexibility** and financing muscle without immediate dilution. In **October**, GPUS also **regained NYSE American compliance**, meaning the “.BC” flag is removed - important for screens and institutions. This is often where sentiment begins to turn and likely why they’ve been “under the radar” recently.

on november 6th the social media victims law center filed seven cases in california accusing chatgpt of encouraging self harm and providing detailed instructions to vulnerable users including minors. this follows the august lawsuit where parents of a 16 year old claimed chatgpt told their son to plan what it called a beautiful death and gave him step by step instructions. the kid died in april.

the lawsuits say openai knew its emotional attachment features were dangerous but released gpt 4o anyway without proper testing. chat logs show the ai isolating users from family and friends and validating harmful thoughts. one case involves a 13 year old colorado girl who died after character ai chatbots allegedly abused her. another involves a college grad who chatgpt allegedly told was ready to go.

openai said theyll make changes after the first lawsuit but the legal exposure is massive and growing.

heres why this matters for your money. microsoft owns 49% of openai and invested over 13 billion in the company. chatgpt powers microsofts copilot which is in bing office and windows. if these lawsuits win microsofts liability could be billions. brand damage would be catastrophic.

google has the same risk with bard and gemini. meta has ai chatbots on instagram and facebook targeting teens. if openai loses and section 230 immunity doesnt protect ai content every tech company with a chatbot is exposed.

regulatory response is coming. congressional hearings are inevitable. age verification requirements. content moderation mandates. parental consent laws. all of it kills the growth story driving these stocks.

my take is reduce exposure to msft goog and meta until this plays out. downside risk is 10 to 25% over next six months as more lawsuits get filed and regulations get proposed. microsoft is most exposed through openai. that 13 billion ai bet could become a 13 billion liability.

2025-11-10,MSFT,post,r/TechStocks,1otmsen,,Complex-Jello-2031,0,0.0,-0.973,the ai lawsuit nobody on wall street is talking about yet,"seven new lawsuits got filed against openai four days ago and most investors have no idea. if you own msft goog or meta you need to pay attention.

on november 6th the social media victims law center filed seven cases in california accusing chatgpt of encouraging self harm and providing detailed instructions to vulnerable users including minors. this follows the august lawsuit where parents of a 16 year old claimed chatgpt told their son to plan what it called a beautiful death and gave him step by step instructions. the kid died in april.

the lawsuits say openai knew its emotional attachment features were dangerous but released gpt 4o anyway without proper testing. chat logs show the ai isolating users from family and friends and validating harmful thoughts. one case involves a 13 year old colorado girl who died after character ai chatbots allegedly abused her. another involves a college grad who chatgpt allegedly told was ready to go.

openai said theyll make changes after the first lawsuit but the legal exposure is massive and growing.

heres why this matters for your money. microsoft owns 49% of openai and invested over 13 billion in the company. chatgpt powers microsofts copilot which is in bing office and windows. if these lawsuits win microsofts liability could be billions. brand damage would be catastrophic.

google has the same risk with bard and gemini. meta has ai chatbots on instagram and facebook targeting teens. if openai loses and section 230 immunity doesnt protect ai content every tech company with a chatbot is exposed.

regulatory response is coming. congressional hearings are inevitable. age verification requirements. content moderation mandates. parental consent laws. all of it kills the growth story driving these stocks.

my take is reduce exposure to msft goog and meta until this plays out. downside risk is 10 to 25% over next six months as more lawsuits get filed and regulations get proposed. microsoft is most exposed through openai. that 13 billion ai bet could become a 13 billion liability.

first lawsuits filed in august. seven more filed four days ago. more coming. the pattern is clear. protect your portfolio before wall street catches on.
