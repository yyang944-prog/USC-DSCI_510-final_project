post,r/stocks,1ohn70r,,1761591589,Alone_Kick_4571,12994,1519.0,Amazon is cutting 30k corporate jobs… and Wall Street is cheering lol,"So Amazon just decided to yeet **30,000 corporate workers** into the sun  
Not warehouse folks Not seasonal hires The people who actually run the machine

And the market’s reaction  
“Yessss daddy Bezos cut more costs please”  
Stock goes up because apparently job losses = line go up

Here’s what’s wild  
Everyone keeps saying AI is overhyped  
Meanwhile Amazon is basically saying  
“We don’t need humans for this anymore”

AWS slowing  
Retail margins razor thin  
Robots and LLMs taking the PowerPoint warriors’ jobs

Imagine being told for years  
“Get a tech job it’s safe”  
Then boom AI says  
“You’re not even middle management material”

This feels less like cost optimization  
and more like a warning shot for white-collar workers everywhere

I’m holding AMZN because tendies  
but damn  
Something about this doesn’t feel bullish for society

Thoughts  
Is this the new normal"

Amazon said the jobs would be replaced by AI. This would represent the largest job cut at Amazon since around 27,000 jobs were eliminated starting in late 2022

Unbelievable, wonder where we will be in a few years with mass unemployment?"
comment,r/stocks,nlsvdzz,t3_1ohn70r,1761645165,portugalthemanband,135,,,"This was one of the biggest pieces of news I came across today. People keep hoping things will get better soon, but honestly, I think we might be heading in the opposite direction. Being overly optimistic doesn’t help much when even solid companies are tightening up. I recently read that job postings dropped by about 13.8%. On top of that, companies are starting to treat sites like LinkedIn more like social media, and a lot of those listings are basically fake.

These days, it just feels smarter for all of us to stay realistic and keep a couple of backup plans since things are way too unstable right now. It feels like the right time to stay active, even if we’re not sending out resumes nonstop; keeping some momentum through small side projects or remote gigs can really make a difference. That’s what I plan to do myself. Luckily I can work remotely, and my suggestion for anyone else is to focus on legitimate remote opportunities and look beyond platforms like LinkedIn. Check job listings daily on smaller, more focused job sites and keep experimenting. Another useful approach is the story of that [developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/) who sent his resume to hundreds of recruitment agencies, a good example of persistence paying off. I’ve also got friends who spent months, even years, searching before finally landing something solid. The economy still moves, just differently now; new methods and niches keep appearing. Personally, I believe having two or three flexible income streams is the smartest move right now. Information and demand change so fast, and meanwhile, the world feels like it’s constantly shaking. I honestly wonder how we’re all going to come out of this phase."

Yall really shouldn’t be investing in anything but the overall market, yall don't seem to understand much about the world. Amazon is fundamentally an engineering company if they’re keeping or hiring engineers, that’s a good thing and if they are firing middle management, that is an extremely good thing.


You’re reading headlines without understanding what’s behind them. The AWS outage? That was a routine technical issue — they happen all the time. How exactly is someone with a business degree supposed to help hardware, software, or network engineers keep the internet running? They don’t. They just clog up the process with meetings, status updates, and unnecessary approvals — basically slowing down the people actually doing the work.

Middle management is one of the biggest problems in modern corporations. Most of them have no clue what the company actually builds, how it’s built, or how to make it better. They exist mostly as roadblocks — more focused on self-preservation than productivity.

Honestly, a lot of people in middle management would’ve been better off learning a trade. Skilled tradespeople are crushing it right now because of the huge labor shortage — and that’s exactly why DIY culture is booming again, even though doing it yourself today is way more complex than it was in our grandparents’ time."

post,r/stocks,1o3d10v,,1760130361,Gamingwishard,11192,1806.0,BREAKING: Trump places 100% tariff on China starting November 1st,"The S&amp;P 500 falls 70+ points in seconds after President Trump publishes the below paragraph about China.

Donald J. Trump Truth Social Post 04:50 PM EST 10/10/25 

It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.

Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.

It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

DONALD J. TRUMP
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"

My prediction is Trump messed up the tactics on this though, they didn't realize China would pull such a huge lever like this. RAE export controls would severely disrupt all AI data centers, defense hardware production, and basically destroy the economy, if it goes on for more than a few weeks.

This is not just TACO, this is an escalation (or just a tit for tat since the USA has tried to kneecap Chinese AI progress). If the USA doesn't fold, that means we're in for a world of short term economic pain that would probably kill the last 3 months of US stock market growth at the minimum.

post,r/stocks,1nxbr66,,1759526936,WickedSensitiveCrew,7346,430.0,"The U.S. dollar fell about 11% against other currencies in the first half of this year, its biggest decline in over 50 years","https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/us-dollar-declines

&gt; The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June. That decline also marked the end of a structural bull cycle for the dollar, which started in 2010 and ended in 2024 with an accumulated gain of about 40%. 

&gt; Although the currency strengthened 3.2% in July, recovering some of this year’s depreciation, Morgan Stanley Research expects the decline to continue, possibly adding another 10% in losses by the end of next year.  “We're likely at the intermission rather than the finale,” says David Adams, head of G10 FX Strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The second act for the dollar’s weakening should come over the next 12 months, as U.S. interest rates and growth converge with those of the rest of the world.” 

&gt; The U.S. currency depreciation could have significant impacts for consumers, businesses, investors and ultimately for the overall economy: It would be more expensive for Americans to travel abroad. U.S. assets could be less compelling for foreign investors. Import prices could rise, putting pressure on inflation. On the positive side, however, the weaker dollar could be a boost for American exporters."

Everyone has been celebrating the big wins YTD, I wouldn't even call them big we have had better bull runs. 14-18% on average gains YTD. 11% of that is because a lot of these companies are global focused so their intrinsic value stayed the same as the dollar got weaker. So you're really at 3-7% gains at the same spending power against international. Add on the slightly higher inflation and you're likely only sitting at 0-3% improvement year over year. I see a decent run on the market until May as the Fed is moving things correctly.  We've also been sheltered on inflation on companies thinking tariffs won't last and play a longer game of exhausting inventories before raising prices. Weak job market and still lowish inflation will allow for small cuts to the interest rate to fuel growth. The struggle is how we get foreign funds wanting to spend or invest in the dollar again to boost the value of the dollar. I feel ok until May, then my 8 ball gets fuzzy. My guess is stocks will be king and cash will be worthless after May."

Trump drops a figurative nuclear bomb on Friday afternoon, the media panics about it over the weekend, markets plummet on Monday, and then he reverses course on Wednesday and everything is back to normal. Trump and his insiders make millions while everyone else gets screwed. 

This H1b policy is so ludicrous, there's no way it can be for real. A sudden $100k annual fee for each h1b employee without any warning is enough to instantly crater many companies and research institutions. Only the tech giants could afford to absorb these costs. It's not just engineers and programmers on h1b, it's researchers, teachers, doctors, nurses, actuaries, mathematicians, etc. using the H1b.

There’s an important caveat about this announcement: it does not affect people who are already on an H1B or that need to renew it. It’s only for new applicants.

For anyone interested:

Trump Signs Proclamation Imposing $100K Annual Fee on H-1B Visas

President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping proclamation that will dramatically raise costs for both skilled foreign workers and wealthy immigrants, in one of the most aggressive immigration policy shifts in decades

Key Changes:

$100,000 Annual H-1B Fee: Employers sponsoring H-1B workers must now pay an annual fee of $100,000 per visa, up from just $215 previously.
Immediate Impacts:

Tech Industry Shock: Silicon Valley companies, already heavily reliant on H-1B visas, face steep new costs. Shares of IT services firms and outsourcing companies dropped following the announcement.
Indian Nationals Most Affected: Indian workers, who historically receive about three-quarters of all H-1B visas, will be hit hardest, potentially losing access to one of the primary employment pathways to the U.S.
Legal Analysis:

While initial reports suggest Trump has broad authority to impose the $100,000 H-1B fee under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 212(f), a closer legal examination reveals both concerning powers and promising limitations.
The Authority is Real, But Limited:

Trump likely does have legal standing to implement these fees—but crucially, only for individuals entering the U.S. on new H-1B visas. This represents a significant but not catastrophic restriction on the program.
Key Limitations Provide Relief:

Several factors substantially limit the proclamation's impact:

Existing Workers Protected: The fees don't apply to H-1B extensions or status changes within the U.S., protecting hundreds of thousands of current visa holders from immediate disruption.
One-Year Expiration: The measures automatically sunset after 12 months unless explicitly renewed, creating built-in pressure for reassessment.
Massive “National Interest” Exception: The most significant limitation lies in subsection (d), which allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive restrictions for individual workers, entire companies, or whole industries when their employment serves “national interests” and poses no security threat.
The Litigation Opportunity:

This national interest exception creates what amounts to a legal superhighway for challenges. Despite its discretionary language, courts can review decisions for abuse of discretion or arbitrary application.
The legal standard strongly favors H-1B workers: demonstrating that skilled employment serves national interests and poses no security threat should be straightforward for most cases. Given USCIS's historically poor record in crafting legally defensible decisions, immigration attorneys anticipate numerous successful challenges.
Strategic Implications:

Rather than a blanket shutdown of H-1B immigration, this proclamation may evolve into a selective enforcement mechanism. Companies and workers willing to navigate the waiver process—and prepared to litigate adverse decisions—may find pathways remain open.
The real test will be how broadly DHS interprets “national interest” and whether courts prove willing to second-guess agency determinations that skilled foreign workers don't serve American economic interests."
comment,r/stocks,nf9w0ef,t3_1nm33ll,1758387342,Lord_Vesuvius2020,69,,,It seems like there are potentially two outcomes here. Either the former H1B employees are offshored (and no longer need H1B) or more US nationals are hired despite being paid more. The latter is the ideal scenario. Of course as others have said there’s yet a third option. In #3 the policy is used as a shakedown. The administration waives the $100k fee in exchange for undisclosed fees the company makes to MAGA causes or administration pockets. Which one of these sounds more likely to you?

comment,r/stocks,nfa6553,t3_1nm33ll,1758390293,TorpedoAway,28,,,"H1B was supposed to give US companies access to expert technical workers not available in the US. Companies used it instead to import cheap technical labor because the only exceptional qualities most H1B workers in jobs like devops, site reliability and most developer jobs is that they are often willing to work long hours for low pay. And they are under their employer's thumb because they're only here so long as their employer is happy. So no complaining about hours or pay. I've worked in tech for a long time and have worked with a lot of H1B co-workers. Overall, a few are quite good, most are average skill easily available in the US for higher wages and some are really entry level. Among the ones who are truly highly skilled and maybe really hard to find domestically, I'm certain the employers will be more than willing to pay the fee. The ones who are only here because they will work for below market wages, well, maybe the employer will pay or maybe the employer will hire a US citizen or other non H1B worker for a fairer wage. The H1B program abuse so far is inline with decisions made in previous decades by American businesses. In previous decades they offshored jobs, in recent decades they disenfranchise American workers by importing cheap substitute labor."

&gt; U.S. employers added far fewer jobs in 2024 and early 2025 than previously thought, indicating the labor market may have been significantly weaker than initial estimates had suggested. The U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months ending in March than previously estimated, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Tuesday. The figure, which exceeded economists' expectations, appears to be the largest revision ever recorded. The preliminary estimate will be finalized next year. The revision, a routine step in the compilation of government labor statistics, assesses monthly survey estimates alongside state unemployment data. 

&gt; The fresh data comes weeks after President Donald Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in response to a weak monthly jobs report. Trump claimed without evidence that McEntarfer had manipulated statistics for political reasons. In a statement on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the unusually large revision cast doubt on the legitimacy of the BLS. Leavitt also appeared to grant credence to the data, citing it as evidence of a weak economy under President Joe Biden. ""Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record proving that President Trump was right: Biden’s economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken. This is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the BLS’s data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions,"" Leavitt said."

If one believes numbers are being manipulated the most obvious explanation would be that Biden was juicing the numbers to look better before the election, since this is essentially all data from his ""watch"". There's cause to think that  given that part of his whole shtik was how great the economy was (and some BlueSky economists will still insist that people were misled by the New York Times or something to incorrectly believe that the economy wasn't the greatest ever) and he did deftly avoid a recession in 2022 by simply refusing to announce one. Of course, people who insist that Donald Trump has put an end to the era of good data will be convinced that the numbers are manipulated now to make it look like job losses on his watch were actually Biden's. And then realists will note that these revisions are pretty common (though these realists are probably not reality based enough for the most part to recognize that these data just generally are not particularly good or nearly as useful as those in the United Church of the Federal Reserve will preach)."

post,r/stocks,1octyv8,,1761093244,Puginator,4121,346.0,Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan,"A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.

On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.

Tesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.

On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.

The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.

“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”

Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk’s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.

Following those firms’ suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, “ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla’s proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.” The company added that shareholders who sold would “have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.”

The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.

Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.

Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having \~25% voting control.” The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.

Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he “vociferously opposes this pay package” and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.

“Most of the time we’ve held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it’s grown over time, and that’s why we haven’t chosen to dump it,” Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he’s preferred to “hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.”

Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.

He said he views Tesla’s board he as “insufficiently independent,” and that it’s allowed Musk to be an “absentee CEO.” The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.

The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it’s still underperforming its tech peers and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.

Musk has “been an inconsistent CEO at best,” Lander said, “and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.”

Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

* **Tranche 3**: $3.0 trillion market cap + 1 million Optimus bots (humanoid robots) delivered (cumulative from grant date).
* **Tranche 4**: $3.5 trillion market cap + 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation (average over three consecutive months; driverless).
* **Tranche 5**: $4.0 trillion market cap + $50 billion adjusted EBITDA (over four consecutive quarters).
* **Tranche 6**: $4.5 trillion market cap + $80 billion adjusted EBITDA (over four consecutive quarters).

The Senate failed to pass an appropriations bill again yesterday.



We've experienced this farce several times. Usually, the market shrugs until some ""real"" problems arise and then everyone pretends they expected it.



But now?



The market remains relatively calm.



Consumer confidence has begun to weaken.



Earnings season is mixed.



And now, the longest government shutdown in history is brewing.



I'm not panicking just hedging and having extra cash on hand.

E.g., it’s different because in prior shutdowns at least both sides of the aisle could come to a PARTIAL agreement on certain departments being left open to operate, like take for example the Department of Energy.

In the instant case, that’s not the case, and everything is shutdown.  

This is going to be extremely problematic in the coming 4-8 weeks as agencies that operate on a reserve are going to run out of funds shortly.

I'm planning on closing most of my positions by end of November. This year has been absolutely insane. Here's a list i compiled of shit that happened since last year.

* Government shutdowns, withholding SNAP benefits, openly defying Supreme Court orders.
* Announcing they will not follow the November 4 Supreme Court order regarding tariffs regardless of the ruling and Trump announcing that he will not be attending it.
* Weaponizing programs like food stamps and tariffs for political leverage.
* Not releasing critical files, e.g., Epstein-related investigations.
* Threatening and deploying the military against U.S. cities
* Publicly mocking citizens on social media (e.g., videos of the President on a plane “shitting on his own people”).
* Tearing down the White House and creating a \~$250M ballroom while citizen are struggling.
* Massive foreign spending: \~$300B to Israel, \~$134Bbillion to Ukraine, $40B bailing out Argentina. Meanwhile own citizens in the USA are struggling.
* Initiating or escalating conflicts in the Middle East.
* Destroying relationships with all trade partners, including supposed closest ally, Canada.
* Encouraging China to become self-reliant in chips/AI, reducing U.S. leverage. This is absolutely regarded.
* Tariffs and trade conflicts undermine global trust in the U.S.
* Global perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner severely damaged.
* U.S. dollar down \~10%.
* Rising inflation which is also likely understated due to misreporting, tariffs, and hidden costs.
* Unemployment officially at 4.3% but doesn’t account for underemployment or labor force dropouts.
* Weekly jobless claims: 219,000
* Billionaires became \~$700B richer in a single year.
* Trump’s administration and allies became significantly wealthier during his term.
* Lower- and middle-income Americans have seen real wages stagnate or decline, and many households are struggling more and more.
* Trump openly discussing “making his friends billions richer” in April with the whole dump.
* Extreme institutional stress: courts, Congress, bureaucracy, and public trust all tested.
* Constitutional defiance, authoritarian behavior, economic instability, wealth consolidation, and foreign policy chaos converge.

A combination of these factors makes this one of the most extraordinary crises in U.S. history and i am genuinely concerned."

The MSCI ex-US index is now outperforming MSCI US, and by the largest margin since 2009, a striking reversal after nearly twenty years of US dominance. For years, the narrative of US exceptionalism in markets has held strong, powered by tech innovation, easy monetary policy, and global capital inflows.

Problem is if US investors go and invest in these markets, and when they take out their money and bring back two dollars, they will suffer a huge loss because the currency keeps on depreciating and the returns. Those Market are making are not enough. For example if a outside us Market makes 16% return and depreciated their currency by 6% then you only made 10% when you got your money back in dollars. So compare the returns in dollar terms not in their own currencies.

If we compare in dollar terms, people will find that US markets have continuously outperformed every year as compared to other markets"

&gt; President Trump's tariffs will cost businesses more than $1.2 trillion this year, with most of that cost being passed on to consumers, according to a new study from S&amp;P Global. 

&gt; In the study published on Thursday, S&amp;P Global found that companies are now expected to pay at least $1.2 trillion more in 2025 expenses than they anticipated on Jan. 1, in what the researchers say is likely a conservative estimate.

&gt; The researchers project that at least two-thirds of ""expense shock"" will be passed on to consumers, with the rest absorbed by companies.

&gt; The $1.2 trillion figure comes via data collected from 15,000 analysts across 9,000 companies. 

&gt;""Tariffs and trade barriers act as taxes on supply chains and divert cash to governments; logistics delays and freight costs compound the effect,"" they wrote."

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

post,r/stocks,1o1ioby,,1759947945,Whalesftw123,2757,499.0,We aren't in the dot com bubble. We're in an anything but cash bubble.,"Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.

The most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.

Right now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.

So how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?

**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**

This is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.

Basically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.

The result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.

In scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).

If you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.

**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**

For the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.

Essentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American capitalism and tech superiority.

I’m aware global equities have performed well in comparison with the US economy in 2025 but what about the past 5 years or Mag7? 

And yes at this point in the cycle there is some capital flight away from US due to the valuations but if America ever dips it’ll come right back.

**In other words, this bull market, and especially the AI industry is so resilient because it's propped up by multiple reasons**

It’s not solely AI being hyped over the moon or OpenAI entangling itself with the entire tech industry.

That alone does not create the market we’re in.

We are in a triple bull market.

Now don't ask me when the music will stop. I don't know.

Although as long as US equities remain the best companies on the planet, cash continues to feel unsafe, ai keeps sparking wild expectations about the future, and global economies (not just looking at 2025 performance) remain relatively weak, I would not be surprised if a significant crash is unlikely.

Conversely if any of this starts to change, it may be worth watching."

But most importantly, Google is doing very well with their AI for enterprise. Gemini is great and it brings a lot of revenue to their cloud business. It's the only real competition to OpenAI and Anthropic (which Google is a significant share holder ...). They have their own TPUs which is another big advantage. 


So all in all, Google search is declining, but many other parts of Google are booming. "

I feel these numbers are barely moving. For a company that has been out for this long, at least that much growth is valid. Also, they are not pulling much (AWS revenue is 30+ billion) and Google cloud is at a third spot since inception.   
And their bread and butter, the search ads: You can yourself see that a lot of queries people used to make now go straight to ChatGPT (coding related queries to Claude or their GPT Powered IDE like Cursor). If these queries were still being funneled to gemini, it would have been a different ballgame, but given this data, I worry about the upcoming future unless they hit another killer product like Android."

comment,r/stocks,nmatdh9,t3_1ojf9mj,1761875351,No-Fig-8614,1,,,"Google is the dark horse in the AI race, it’s more obvious now but they have everything needed to win. They have the talent, the research, the data centers, the chips, the data, and the firehose of cash. 

You look at OpenAi and they have talent, research, and that’s about it. 

Anthropic the same as OpenAi. 

Microsoft has the data centers, the research, the cash, and that’s about it (other than the stake in open ai). 

Apple has the talent, the cash and that’s about it. 

Meta had the cash and data. 

Nvidia has the cash, and talent/research (you would assume chips but they really don’t have much physical assets)

Oracle has the data centers and cash.

Amazon has the cash, the data centers, arguably the chips, and maybe a bit of talent. 

Intel is also going to be a dark horse, they will have the foundries and the existing chip design to go off of. Most people don’t realize with intel that they basically have bought out all of ASML’s tooling for the next few years. Their new nodes are proving to be great. While AMD will have chips but just contract to co develop. Same with Qualcomm and Broadcom, although Broadcom is helping the TPU development for Google. 

Now we wonder what happens with all the ASIC providers: Cerberus, Groq, SambaNova, Positron, and who else? They are all just going to survive on export controls and foreign money. 

So at the end o of the day Google can cruise along with their current portfolio of benefits but the rest have to buy into one way or another. Microsoft needs to use their stake in OpenAI, Amazon needs to buy their stake in Anthropic, Oracle just will be Oracle, Meta is always creative and will find some other thing to go after."

post,r/stocks,1n47cuu,,1756574798,Brewskwondo,2583,396.0,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&amp;P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	•	NFLX – +$418.00 (+458.53%)
	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)
	•	GOOG – +$274.54 (+83.55%)
	•	AAPL – +$59.88 (+79.60%)
	•	MAR – +$39.44 (+75.69%)
	•	AMZN – +$75.66 (+66.14%)
	•	TSLA – +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&amp;P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts. 

Edit: Hilarious to me that this got flagged as misleading or unverified. I literally tried to post the image of the account with the same info above but this sub wouldn’t let me attach images. "

&gt;Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley says US buyers aren't interested in $75,000 electric vehicles and the automaker doesn't want to keep living in Tesla's (TSLA) shadow.

&gt;""We've learned ... people are not willing to pay \[a\] $30,000 premium for that big battery on a \[$50,000\], $60,000 utility,"" Farley told Yahoo Finance at Ford's Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit, Mich. ""But they're willing to buy a $30,000 EV if they save $2,000 a year compared to gas costs.""

&gt;Farley's comments underscore the challenges Ford faces as it pushes further into EVs. While global EV demand grows, price sensitivity is shaping which models will succeed."

Mr. Musk buys $1B worth of TSLA stock, which he is employed with, earned that $1B from TSLA, and will get $1B performance pay from TSLA. So, the same money is circulated.

Earlier ORCL and top few companies teamed up to buy/sell among each other to boost their own stock evaluations. It is circular cash flow with in the top few companies. The result was an unbelievable 2 hour boost of 35%+ to a billion dollar company! Since we have more information now a days than what it was 50 years ago (it was via news papers only), this type of sudden move is insane.

Now if you look at the richest people in the world their wealth is mostly tied up in public companies. Meaning you can directly tie the direction of your wealth to theirs. 


If you believe they will do **everything** possible, including market manipulation and bribing politicians and world leaders, so their wealth keeps growing, instead of complaining it’s easy to just buy their stocks and say: if their wealth goes down so will mine, if their wealth goes up so will mine


I bought oklo the day their chair (I might be off on the title) joined the Trump administration. I still believe he will do everything in his power to keep the stock pumping

post,r/stocks,1ohfc9l,,1761573997,Puginator,2285,804.0,"Tesla risks losing CEO Musk if $1 trillion pay package isn’t approved, board chair says","Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm, in a letter Monday, asked shareholders to vote for CEO Elon Musk’s nearly $1 trillion pay package ahead of the company’s annual meeting.

Denholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company,” with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus.

“Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” Denholm wrote.

Denholm told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that the company is at an “important inflection point” with artificial intelligence at the forefront.

“The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,” she said.

Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommending against it.

Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk’s embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.

Tesla’s annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for Musk’s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.

Tesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines.

The proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla’s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots.

“If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk said to analysts. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

“He’s been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can’t happen with the AI,” Denholm told CNBC. “So it’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence.”

Denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla’s shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote.

She also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.

Truthfully told, it's a characteristic of jealousy more-so than anything.

1) He isn't getting paid $1 trillion. Stock options =/= cash. Try liquidating 1/8th of a company and then tell me you're getting full market value.

2) He only gets paid if he meets performance objectives or thresholds. Tesla would have to x8 for him to get the full $1 trillion. Tons of you don't even believe Tesla will survive that long. So he effectively gets nothing if he doesn't meet these objectives. What's your issue with that?

3) If you're not a shareholder, why does this bother you? Any shareholder would love to have their shares go up 800% and wouldn't mind their CEO getting paid that. This stems from jealousy.

4) Again, if you don't own Tesla shares and don't believe in Tesla, then he effectively gets nothing. $0. His shares are worth nothing because as many of you said, ""Tesla is just a fake company that Elon pumps."" So this just proves that ya'll are upset that he's getting paid to do something most think can't be done... AKA, you're proving he deserves it.

5) This is the same shit that happened many years ago in his original performance package. Many thought Tesla was going to go bankrupt and it was true, they were. They managed to not go bankrupt, sell hundreds of thousands of EV's, become profitable, and then Elon got paid. So he does something that had a very low chance of success and you guys are upset he got rewarded for it.

  
Get your head out of your asses, guys. This isn't your money. This is Tesla, as a company, holding the shares. We're all in this to make money. Stop being jealous and find something else to make money on if this upsets you."

Bought BYND calls. 7k on Tuesday 10/14 at open. 1$ for 10/24. 665 of them. Preached it to friends at work who laughed. Wednesday-Friday was ridiculed for the stock “plummeting”. People litterally started putting up wall art with my investment strategies on full display.  Sold the options Friday around 9am for 3k loss. Woke up Monday to quite the regret.  Tuesday was worse and Wednesday at the peak was a pain I cannot describe. So at this point I decide to buy back In but just 1k this time at a 8.50 strike. It immediately plummets.

So my portfolio is all cash right now.  I also sold my 2 BTC yesterday and all of my DOGE today.

The biggest thing was accepting that I might miss out on hypothetical gains if the market continued to remain bullish, but every indicator told me it was overbought and the house of cards was about to break.  The PPI numbers and job numbers were two big red flags.  I'm expecting the Fed to NOT lower rates after their Sept meeting, so I might buy puts."

The “Trump always wins” crowd is ignoring that most of Trump’s victories lately have been over issues that conservative legal thinkers have been after for a long time.  But presidential “emergency powers” is not one of those issues, and the Court knows dems will take the presidency eventually — they aren’t dumb.  

I think there’s a higher chance of Roberts and one of Barrett or Kav siding with the liberals and striking these tariffs down than people think. FWIW, just my two cents."

Hello friends, I have been a trump supporter for awhile. But today I'm no longer republican. I'm afraid Trump is in bed with the Chinese and the big tech giants. When everyone loses jobs from AI we will have mass starvation unless something is done soon. Also be very careful of the internet and AI it will be a tool of suppression and propaganda.  Internet+AI=complete mindfuck. So be careful of psychosis and mental problems. I hope Humanity will prevail in the end and we will see  hope again.  I recommend doing some research into AI safety like Dr. Roman Yampolskiy. I hope if their is a god or Jesus he does something. Also read into the Great Leap Forward. This is similar to what is happening today. Just know this is happening all over around the world not just the U.S. We are just the biggest retards."

The stock tanked with everything else in April during liberation day and I was down to $526. I had to deposit another $10,000 to pick myself up and take revenge on the market. 

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. 

The last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract. "

Example: sell shares and buy LEAPS, shift from QQQ to TQQQ, etc.


Yeah, risky but it is a way to in-essence buy the dip. I might do that if QQQ drops 15% from ATH. Still sucks waiting for 15% drop though. Prefer that we are done and just see a V recovery.

Positive catalysts:
- Trump keeps China meeting

- progress on China deal

- gov shutdown ending

Fingers crossed."
