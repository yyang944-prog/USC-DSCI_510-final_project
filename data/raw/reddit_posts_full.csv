post,r/stocks,1ohn70r,,1761591589,Alone_Kick_4571,12996,1519.0,Amazon is cutting 30k corporate jobs… and Wall Street is cheering lol,"So Amazon just decided to yeet **30,000 corporate workers** into the sun  
Not warehouse folks Not seasonal hires The people who actually run the machine

And the market’s reaction  
“Yessss daddy Bezos cut more costs please”  
Stock goes up because apparently job losses = line go up

Here’s what’s wild  
Everyone keeps saying AI is overhyped  
Meanwhile Amazon is basically saying  
“We don’t need humans for this anymore”

AWS slowing  
Retail margins razor thin  
Robots and LLMs taking the PowerPoint warriors’ jobs

Imagine being told for years  
“Get a tech job it’s safe”  
Then boom AI says  
“You’re not even middle management material”

This feels less like cost optimization  
and more like a warning shot for white-collar workers everywhere

I’m holding AMZN because tendies  
but damn  
Something about this doesn’t feel bullish for society

Thoughts  
Is this the new normal"

Amazon said the jobs would be replaced by AI. This would represent the largest job cut at Amazon since around 27,000 jobs were eliminated starting in late 2022

Unbelievable, wonder where we will be in a few years with mass unemployment?"
comment,r/stocks,nlsvdzz,t3_1ohn70r,1761645165,portugalthemanband,135,,,"This was one of the biggest pieces of news I came across today. People keep hoping things will get better soon, but honestly, I think we might be heading in the opposite direction. Being overly optimistic doesn’t help much when even solid companies are tightening up. I recently read that job postings dropped by about 13.8%. On top of that, companies are starting to treat sites like LinkedIn more like social media, and a lot of those listings are basically fake.

These days, it just feels smarter for all of us to stay realistic and keep a couple of backup plans since things are way too unstable right now. It feels like the right time to stay active, even if we’re not sending out resumes nonstop; keeping some momentum through small side projects or remote gigs can really make a difference. That’s what I plan to do myself. Luckily I can work remotely, and my suggestion for anyone else is to focus on legitimate remote opportunities and look beyond platforms like LinkedIn. Check job listings daily on smaller, more focused job sites and keep experimenting. Another useful approach is the story of that [developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/) who sent his resume to hundreds of recruitment agencies, a good example of persistence paying off. I’ve also got friends who spent months, even years, searching before finally landing something solid. The economy still moves, just differently now; new methods and niches keep appearing. Personally, I believe having two or three flexible income streams is the smartest move right now. Information and demand change so fast, and meanwhile, the world feels like it’s constantly shaking. I honestly wonder how we’re all going to come out of this phase."

Yall really shouldn’t be investing in anything but the overall market, yall don't seem to understand much about the world. Amazon is fundamentally an engineering company if they’re keeping or hiring engineers, that’s a good thing and if they are firing middle management, that is an extremely good thing.


You’re reading headlines without understanding what’s behind them. The AWS outage? That was a routine technical issue — they happen all the time. How exactly is someone with a business degree supposed to help hardware, software, or network engineers keep the internet running? They don’t. They just clog up the process with meetings, status updates, and unnecessary approvals — basically slowing down the people actually doing the work.

Middle management is one of the biggest problems in modern corporations. Most of them have no clue what the company actually builds, how it’s built, or how to make it better. They exist mostly as roadblocks — more focused on self-preservation than productivity.

Honestly, a lot of people in middle management would’ve been better off learning a trade. Skilled tradespeople are crushing it right now because of the huge labor shortage — and that’s exactly why DIY culture is booming again, even though doing it yourself today is way more complex than it was in our grandparents’ time."

post,r/stocks,1o3d10v,,1760130361,Gamingwishard,11193,1806.0,BREAKING: Trump places 100% tariff on China starting November 1st,"The S&amp;P 500 falls 70+ points in seconds after President Trump publishes the below paragraph about China.

Donald J. Trump Truth Social Post 04:50 PM EST 10/10/25 

It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.

Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.

It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

DONALD J. TRUMP
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"

My prediction is Trump messed up the tactics on this though, they didn't realize China would pull such a huge lever like this. RAE export controls would severely disrupt all AI data centers, defense hardware production, and basically destroy the economy, if it goes on for more than a few weeks.

This is not just TACO, this is an escalation (or just a tit for tat since the USA has tried to kneecap Chinese AI progress). If the USA doesn't fold, that means we're in for a world of short term economic pain that would probably kill the last 3 months of US stock market growth at the minimum.

post,r/stocks,1nxbr66,,1759526936,WickedSensitiveCrew,7353,430.0,"The U.S. dollar fell about 11% against other currencies in the first half of this year, its biggest decline in over 50 years","https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/us-dollar-declines

&gt; The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June. That decline also marked the end of a structural bull cycle for the dollar, which started in 2010 and ended in 2024 with an accumulated gain of about 40%. 

&gt; Although the currency strengthened 3.2% in July, recovering some of this year’s depreciation, Morgan Stanley Research expects the decline to continue, possibly adding another 10% in losses by the end of next year.  “We're likely at the intermission rather than the finale,” says David Adams, head of G10 FX Strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The second act for the dollar’s weakening should come over the next 12 months, as U.S. interest rates and growth converge with those of the rest of the world.” 

&gt; The U.S. currency depreciation could have significant impacts for consumers, businesses, investors and ultimately for the overall economy: It would be more expensive for Americans to travel abroad. U.S. assets could be less compelling for foreign investors. Import prices could rise, putting pressure on inflation. On the positive side, however, the weaker dollar could be a boost for American exporters."

Everyone has been celebrating the big wins YTD, I wouldn't even call them big we have had better bull runs. 14-18% on average gains YTD. 11% of that is because a lot of these companies are global focused so their intrinsic value stayed the same as the dollar got weaker. So you're really at 3-7% gains at the same spending power against international. Add on the slightly higher inflation and you're likely only sitting at 0-3% improvement year over year. I see a decent run on the market until May as the Fed is moving things correctly.  We've also been sheltered on inflation on companies thinking tariffs won't last and play a longer game of exhausting inventories before raising prices. Weak job market and still lowish inflation will allow for small cuts to the interest rate to fuel growth. The struggle is how we get foreign funds wanting to spend or invest in the dollar again to boost the value of the dollar. I feel ok until May, then my 8 ball gets fuzzy. My guess is stocks will be king and cash will be worthless after May."

Trump drops a figurative nuclear bomb on Friday afternoon, the media panics about it over the weekend, markets plummet on Monday, and then he reverses course on Wednesday and everything is back to normal. Trump and his insiders make millions while everyone else gets screwed. 

This H1b policy is so ludicrous, there's no way it can be for real. A sudden $100k annual fee for each h1b employee without any warning is enough to instantly crater many companies and research institutions. Only the tech giants could afford to absorb these costs. It's not just engineers and programmers on h1b, it's researchers, teachers, doctors, nurses, actuaries, mathematicians, etc. using the H1b.

There’s an important caveat about this announcement: it does not affect people who are already on an H1B or that need to renew it. It’s only for new applicants.

For anyone interested:

Trump Signs Proclamation Imposing $100K Annual Fee on H-1B Visas

President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping proclamation that will dramatically raise costs for both skilled foreign workers and wealthy immigrants, in one of the most aggressive immigration policy shifts in decades

Key Changes:

$100,000 Annual H-1B Fee: Employers sponsoring H-1B workers must now pay an annual fee of $100,000 per visa, up from just $215 previously.
Immediate Impacts:

Tech Industry Shock: Silicon Valley companies, already heavily reliant on H-1B visas, face steep new costs. Shares of IT services firms and outsourcing companies dropped following the announcement.
Indian Nationals Most Affected: Indian workers, who historically receive about three-quarters of all H-1B visas, will be hit hardest, potentially losing access to one of the primary employment pathways to the U.S.
Legal Analysis:

While initial reports suggest Trump has broad authority to impose the $100,000 H-1B fee under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 212(f), a closer legal examination reveals both concerning powers and promising limitations.
The Authority is Real, But Limited:

Trump likely does have legal standing to implement these fees—but crucially, only for individuals entering the U.S. on new H-1B visas. This represents a significant but not catastrophic restriction on the program.
Key Limitations Provide Relief:

Several factors substantially limit the proclamation's impact:

Existing Workers Protected: The fees don't apply to H-1B extensions or status changes within the U.S., protecting hundreds of thousands of current visa holders from immediate disruption.
One-Year Expiration: The measures automatically sunset after 12 months unless explicitly renewed, creating built-in pressure for reassessment.
Massive “National Interest” Exception: The most significant limitation lies in subsection (d), which allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive restrictions for individual workers, entire companies, or whole industries when their employment serves “national interests” and poses no security threat.
The Litigation Opportunity:

This national interest exception creates what amounts to a legal superhighway for challenges. Despite its discretionary language, courts can review decisions for abuse of discretion or arbitrary application.
The legal standard strongly favors H-1B workers: demonstrating that skilled employment serves national interests and poses no security threat should be straightforward for most cases. Given USCIS's historically poor record in crafting legally defensible decisions, immigration attorneys anticipate numerous successful challenges.
Strategic Implications:

Rather than a blanket shutdown of H-1B immigration, this proclamation may evolve into a selective enforcement mechanism. Companies and workers willing to navigate the waiver process—and prepared to litigate adverse decisions—may find pathways remain open.
The real test will be how broadly DHS interprets “national interest” and whether courts prove willing to second-guess agency determinations that skilled foreign workers don't serve American economic interests."
comment,r/stocks,nf9w0ef,t3_1nm33ll,1758387342,Lord_Vesuvius2020,69,,,It seems like there are potentially two outcomes here. Either the former H1B employees are offshored (and no longer need H1B) or more US nationals are hired despite being paid more. The latter is the ideal scenario. Of course as others have said there’s yet a third option. In #3 the policy is used as a shakedown. The administration waives the $100k fee in exchange for undisclosed fees the company makes to MAGA causes or administration pockets. Which one of these sounds more likely to you?

comment,r/stocks,nfa6553,t3_1nm33ll,1758390293,TorpedoAway,26,,,"H1B was supposed to give US companies access to expert technical workers not available in the US. Companies used it instead to import cheap technical labor because the only exceptional qualities most H1B workers in jobs like devops, site reliability and most developer jobs is that they are often willing to work long hours for low pay. And they are under their employer's thumb because they're only here so long as their employer is happy. So no complaining about hours or pay. I've worked in tech for a long time and have worked with a lot of H1B co-workers. Overall, a few are quite good, most are average skill easily available in the US for higher wages and some are really entry level. Among the ones who are truly highly skilled and maybe really hard to find domestically, I'm certain the employers will be more than willing to pay the fee. The ones who are only here because they will work for below market wages, well, maybe the employer will pay or maybe the employer will hire a US citizen or other non H1B worker for a fairer wage. The H1B program abuse so far is inline with decisions made in previous decades by American businesses. In previous decades they offshored jobs, in recent decades they disenfranchise American workers by importing cheap substitute labor."

&gt; U.S. employers added far fewer jobs in 2024 and early 2025 than previously thought, indicating the labor market may have been significantly weaker than initial estimates had suggested. The U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months ending in March than previously estimated, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Tuesday. The figure, which exceeded economists' expectations, appears to be the largest revision ever recorded. The preliminary estimate will be finalized next year. The revision, a routine step in the compilation of government labor statistics, assesses monthly survey estimates alongside state unemployment data. 

&gt; The fresh data comes weeks after President Donald Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in response to a weak monthly jobs report. Trump claimed without evidence that McEntarfer had manipulated statistics for political reasons. In a statement on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the unusually large revision cast doubt on the legitimacy of the BLS. Leavitt also appeared to grant credence to the data, citing it as evidence of a weak economy under President Joe Biden. ""Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record proving that President Trump was right: Biden’s economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken. This is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the BLS’s data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions,"" Leavitt said."

If one believes numbers are being manipulated the most obvious explanation would be that Biden was juicing the numbers to look better before the election, since this is essentially all data from his ""watch"". There's cause to think that  given that part of his whole shtik was how great the economy was (and some BlueSky economists will still insist that people were misled by the New York Times or something to incorrectly believe that the economy wasn't the greatest ever) and he did deftly avoid a recession in 2022 by simply refusing to announce one. Of course, people who insist that Donald Trump has put an end to the era of good data will be convinced that the numbers are manipulated now to make it look like job losses on his watch were actually Biden's. And then realists will note that these revisions are pretty common (though these realists are probably not reality based enough for the most part to recognize that these data just generally are not particularly good or nearly as useful as those in the United Church of the Federal Reserve will preach)."

post,r/stocks,1octyv8,,1761093244,Puginator,4120,346.0,Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan,"A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.

On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.

Tesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.

On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.

The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.

“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”

Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk’s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.

Following those firms’ suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, “ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla’s proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.” The company added that shareholders who sold would “have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.”

The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.

Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.

Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having \~25% voting control.” The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.

Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he “vociferously opposes this pay package” and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.

“Most of the time we’ve held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it’s grown over time, and that’s why we haven’t chosen to dump it,” Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he’s preferred to “hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.”

Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.

He said he views Tesla’s board he as “insufficiently independent,” and that it’s allowed Musk to be an “absentee CEO.” The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.

The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it’s still underperforming its tech peers and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.

Musk has “been an inconsistent CEO at best,” Lander said, “and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.”

Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

* **Tranche 3**: $3.0 trillion market cap + 1 million Optimus bots (humanoid robots) delivered (cumulative from grant date).
* **Tranche 4**: $3.5 trillion market cap + 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation (average over three consecutive months; driverless).
* **Tranche 5**: $4.0 trillion market cap + $50 billion adjusted EBITDA (over four consecutive quarters).
* **Tranche 6**: $4.5 trillion market cap + $80 billion adjusted EBITDA (over four consecutive quarters).
* **Tranche 7**: $5.0 trillion market cap + $130 billion adjusted EBITDA (over four consecutive quarters).

The Senate failed to pass an appropriations bill again yesterday.



We've experienced this farce several times. Usually, the market shrugs until some ""real"" problems arise and then everyone pretends they expected it.



But now?



The market remains relatively calm.



Consumer confidence has begun to weaken.



Earnings season is mixed.



And now, the longest government shutdown in history is brewing.



I'm not panicking just hedging and having extra cash on hand.

E.g., it’s different because in prior shutdowns at least both sides of the aisle could come to a PARTIAL agreement on certain departments being left open to operate, like take for example the Department of Energy.

In the instant case, that’s not the case, and everything is shutdown.  

This is going to be extremely problematic in the coming 4-8 weeks as agencies that operate on a reserve are going to run out of funds shortly.

I'm planning on closing most of my positions by end of November. This year has been absolutely insane. Here's a list i compiled of shit that happened since last year.

* Government shutdowns, withholding SNAP benefits, openly defying Supreme Court orders.
* Announcing they will not follow the November 4 Supreme Court order regarding tariffs regardless of the ruling and Trump announcing that he will not be attending it.
* Weaponizing programs like food stamps and tariffs for political leverage.
* Not releasing critical files, e.g., Epstein-related investigations.
* Threatening and deploying the military against U.S. cities
* Publicly mocking citizens on social media (e.g., videos of the President on a plane “shitting on his own people”).
* Tearing down the White House and creating a \~$250M ballroom while citizen are struggling.
* Massive foreign spending: \~$300B to Israel, \~$134Bbillion to Ukraine, $40B bailing out Argentina. Meanwhile own citizens in the USA are struggling.
* Initiating or escalating conflicts in the Middle East.
* Destroying relationships with all trade partners, including supposed closest ally, Canada.
* Encouraging China to become self-reliant in chips/AI, reducing U.S. leverage. This is absolutely regarded.
* Tariffs and trade conflicts undermine global trust in the U.S.
* Global perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner severely damaged.
* U.S. dollar down \~10%.
* Rising inflation which is also likely understated due to misreporting, tariffs, and hidden costs.
* Unemployment officially at 4.3% but doesn’t account for underemployment or labor force dropouts.
* Weekly jobless claims: 219,000
* Billionaires became \~$700B richer in a single year.
* Trump’s administration and allies became significantly wealthier during his term.
* Lower- and middle-income Americans have seen real wages stagnate or decline, and many households are struggling more and more.
* Trump openly discussing “making his friends billions richer” in April with the whole dump.
* Extreme institutional stress: courts, Congress, bureaucracy, and public trust all tested.
* Constitutional defiance, authoritarian behavior, economic instability, wealth consolidation, and foreign policy chaos converge.

A combination of these factors makes this one of the most extraordinary crises in U.S. history and i am genuinely concerned."

The MSCI ex-US index is now outperforming MSCI US, and by the largest margin since 2009, a striking reversal after nearly twenty years of US dominance. For years, the narrative of US exceptionalism in markets has held strong, powered by tech innovation, easy monetary policy, and global capital inflows.

Problem is if US investors go and invest in these markets, and when they take out their money and bring back two dollars, they will suffer a huge loss because the currency keeps on depreciating and the returns. Those Market are making are not enough. For example if a outside us Market makes 16% return and depreciated their currency by 6% then you only made 10% when you got your money back in dollars. So compare the returns in dollar terms not in their own currencies.

If we compare in dollar terms, people will find that US markets have continuously outperformed every year as compared to other markets"

&gt; President Trump's tariffs will cost businesses more than $1.2 trillion this year, with most of that cost being passed on to consumers, according to a new study from S&amp;P Global. 

&gt; In the study published on Thursday, S&amp;P Global found that companies are now expected to pay at least $1.2 trillion more in 2025 expenses than they anticipated on Jan. 1, in what the researchers say is likely a conservative estimate.

&gt; The researchers project that at least two-thirds of ""expense shock"" will be passed on to consumers, with the rest absorbed by companies.

&gt; The $1.2 trillion figure comes via data collected from 15,000 analysts across 9,000 companies. 

&gt;""Tariffs and trade barriers act as taxes on supply chains and divert cash to governments; logistics delays and freight costs compound the effect,"" they wrote."

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

post,r/stocks,1o1ioby,,1759947945,Whalesftw123,2755,499.0,We aren't in the dot com bubble. We're in an anything but cash bubble.,"Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.

The most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.

Right now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.

So how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?

**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**

This is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.

Basically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.

The result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.

In scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).

If you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.

**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**

For the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.

Essentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American capitalism and tech superiority.

I’m aware global equities have performed well in comparison with the US economy in 2025 but what about the past 5 years or Mag7? 

And yes at this point in the cycle there is some capital flight away from US due to the valuations but if America ever dips it’ll come right back.

**In other words, this bull market, and especially the AI industry is so resilient because it's propped up by multiple reasons**

It’s not solely AI being hyped over the moon or OpenAI entangling itself with the entire tech industry.

That alone does not create the market we’re in.

We are in a triple bull market.

Now don't ask me when the music will stop. I don't know.

Although as long as US equities remain the best companies on the planet, cash continues to feel unsafe, ai keeps sparking wild expectations about the future, and global economies (not just looking at 2025 performance) remain relatively weak, I would not be surprised if a significant crash is unlikely.

Conversely if any of this starts to change, it may be worth watching."

But most importantly, Google is doing very well with their AI for enterprise. Gemini is great and it brings a lot of revenue to their cloud business. It's the only real competition to OpenAI and Anthropic (which Google is a significant share holder ...). They have their own TPUs which is another big advantage. 


So all in all, Google search is declining, but many other parts of Google are booming. "

I feel these numbers are barely moving. For a company that has been out for this long, at least that much growth is valid. Also, they are not pulling much (AWS revenue is 30+ billion) and Google cloud is at a third spot since inception.   
And their bread and butter, the search ads: You can yourself see that a lot of queries people used to make now go straight to ChatGPT (coding related queries to Claude or their GPT Powered IDE like Cursor). If these queries were still being funneled to gemini, it would have been a different ballgame, but given this data, I worry about the upcoming future unless they hit another killer product like Android."

comment,r/stocks,nmatdh9,t3_1ojf9mj,1761875351,No-Fig-8614,1,,,"Google is the dark horse in the AI race, it’s more obvious now but they have everything needed to win. They have the talent, the research, the data centers, the chips, the data, and the firehose of cash. 

You look at OpenAi and they have talent, research, and that’s about it. 

Anthropic the same as OpenAi. 

Microsoft has the data centers, the research, the cash, and that’s about it (other than the stake in open ai). 

Apple has the talent, the cash and that’s about it. 

Meta had the cash and data. 

Nvidia has the cash, and talent/research (you would assume chips but they really don’t have much physical assets)

Oracle has the data centers and cash.

Amazon has the cash, the data centers, arguably the chips, and maybe a bit of talent. 

Intel is also going to be a dark horse, they will have the foundries and the existing chip design to go off of. Most people don’t realize with intel that they basically have bought out all of ASML’s tooling for the next few years. Their new nodes are proving to be great. While AMD will have chips but just contract to co develop. Same with Qualcomm and Broadcom, although Broadcom is helping the TPU development for Google. 

Now we wonder what happens with all the ASIC providers: Cerberus, Groq, SambaNova, Positron, and who else? They are all just going to survive on export controls and foreign money. 

So at the end o of the day Google can cruise along with their current portfolio of benefits but the rest have to buy into one way or another. Microsoft needs to use their stake in OpenAI, Amazon needs to buy their stake in Anthropic, Oracle just will be Oracle, Meta is always creative and will find some other thing to go after."

post,r/stocks,1n47cuu,,1756574798,Brewskwondo,2583,396.0,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&amp;P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	•	NFLX – +$418.00 (+458.53%)
	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)
	•	GOOG – +$274.54 (+83.55%)
	•	AAPL – +$59.88 (+79.60%)
	•	MAR – +$39.44 (+75.69%)
	•	AMZN – +$75.66 (+66.14%)
	•	TSLA – +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&amp;P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts. 

Edit: Hilarious to me that this got flagged as misleading or unverified. I literally tried to post the image of the account with the same info above but this sub wouldn’t let me attach images. "

&gt;Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley says US buyers aren't interested in $75,000 electric vehicles and the automaker doesn't want to keep living in Tesla's (TSLA) shadow.

&gt;""We've learned ... people are not willing to pay \[a\] $30,000 premium for that big battery on a \[$50,000\], $60,000 utility,"" Farley told Yahoo Finance at Ford's Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit, Mich. ""But they're willing to buy a $30,000 EV if they save $2,000 a year compared to gas costs.""

&gt;Farley's comments underscore the challenges Ford faces as it pushes further into EVs. While global EV demand grows, price sensitivity is shaping which models will succeed."

Mr. Musk buys $1B worth of TSLA stock, which he is employed with, earned that $1B from TSLA, and will get $1B performance pay from TSLA. So, the same money is circulated.

Earlier ORCL and top few companies teamed up to buy/sell among each other to boost their own stock evaluations. It is circular cash flow with in the top few companies. The result was an unbelievable 2 hour boost of 35%+ to a billion dollar company! Since we have more information now a days than what it was 50 years ago (it was via news papers only), this type of sudden move is insane.

Now if you look at the richest people in the world their wealth is mostly tied up in public companies. Meaning you can directly tie the direction of your wealth to theirs. 


If you believe they will do **everything** possible, including market manipulation and bribing politicians and world leaders, so their wealth keeps growing, instead of complaining it’s easy to just buy their stocks and say: if their wealth goes down so will mine, if their wealth goes up so will mine


I bought oklo the day their chair (I might be off on the title) joined the Trump administration. I still believe he will do everything in his power to keep the stock pumping

post,r/stocks,1ohfc9l,,1761573997,Puginator,2285,804.0,"Tesla risks losing CEO Musk if $1 trillion pay package isn’t approved, board chair says","Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm, in a letter Monday, asked shareholders to vote for CEO Elon Musk’s nearly $1 trillion pay package ahead of the company’s annual meeting.

Denholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company,” with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus.

“Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” Denholm wrote.

Denholm told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that the company is at an “important inflection point” with artificial intelligence at the forefront.

“The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,” she said.

Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommending against it.

Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk’s embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.

Tesla’s annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for Musk’s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.

Tesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines.

The proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla’s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots.

“If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk said to analysts. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

“He’s been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can’t happen with the AI,” Denholm told CNBC. “So it’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence.”

Denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla’s shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote.

She also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.

Truthfully told, it's a characteristic of jealousy more-so than anything.

1) He isn't getting paid $1 trillion. Stock options =/= cash. Try liquidating 1/8th of a company and then tell me you're getting full market value.

2) He only gets paid if he meets performance objectives or thresholds. Tesla would have to x8 for him to get the full $1 trillion. Tons of you don't even believe Tesla will survive that long. So he effectively gets nothing if he doesn't meet these objectives. What's your issue with that?

3) If you're not a shareholder, why does this bother you? Any shareholder would love to have their shares go up 800% and wouldn't mind their CEO getting paid that. This stems from jealousy.

4) Again, if you don't own Tesla shares and don't believe in Tesla, then he effectively gets nothing. $0. His shares are worth nothing because as many of you said, ""Tesla is just a fake company that Elon pumps."" So this just proves that ya'll are upset that he's getting paid to do something most think can't be done... AKA, you're proving he deserves it.

5) This is the same shit that happened many years ago in his original performance package. Many thought Tesla was going to go bankrupt and it was true, they were. They managed to not go bankrupt, sell hundreds of thousands of EV's, become profitable, and then Elon got paid. So he does something that had a very low chance of success and you guys are upset he got rewarded for it.

  
Get your head out of your asses, guys. This isn't your money. This is Tesla, as a company, holding the shares. We're all in this to make money. Stop being jealous and find something else to make money on if this upsets you."

Bought BYND calls. 7k on Tuesday 10/14 at open. 1$ for 10/24. 665 of them. Preached it to friends at work who laughed. Wednesday-Friday was ridiculed for the stock “plummeting”. People litterally started putting up wall art with my investment strategies on full display.  Sold the options Friday around 9am for 3k loss. Woke up Monday to quite the regret.  Tuesday was worse and Wednesday at the peak was a pain I cannot describe. So at this point I decide to buy back In but just 1k this time at a 8.50 strike. It immediately plummets.

So my portfolio is all cash right now.  I also sold my 2 BTC yesterday and all of my DOGE today.

The biggest thing was accepting that I might miss out on hypothetical gains if the market continued to remain bullish, but every indicator told me it was overbought and the house of cards was about to break.  The PPI numbers and job numbers were two big red flags.  I'm expecting the Fed to NOT lower rates after their Sept meeting, so I might buy puts."

The “Trump always wins” crowd is ignoring that most of Trump’s victories lately have been over issues that conservative legal thinkers have been after for a long time.  But presidential “emergency powers” is not one of those issues, and the Court knows dems will take the presidency eventually — they aren’t dumb.  

I think there’s a higher chance of Roberts and one of Barrett or Kav siding with the liberals and striking these tariffs down than people think. FWIW, just my two cents."

Hello friends, I have been a trump supporter for awhile. But today I'm no longer republican. I'm afraid Trump is in bed with the Chinese and the big tech giants. When everyone loses jobs from AI we will have mass starvation unless something is done soon. Also be very careful of the internet and AI it will be a tool of suppression and propaganda.  Internet+AI=complete mindfuck. So be careful of psychosis and mental problems. I hope Humanity will prevail in the end and we will see  hope again.  I recommend doing some research into AI safety like Dr. Roman Yampolskiy. I hope if their is a god or Jesus he does something. Also read into the Great Leap Forward. This is similar to what is happening today. Just know this is happening all over around the world not just the U.S. We are just the biggest retards."

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. 

The last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract. "

comment,r/wallstreetbets,nc974jy,t3_1n7n2ll,1756930939,Decembrio,90,,,"ELI5:
What happened?

They started with some money, lost almost all of it

Had about $150,000 in stocks (mainly NVDA).
Market dipped, their account dropped to just $526.
Added $10,000 more to try again.

They switched focus to Google (GOOG/GOOGL)

Thought it was undervalued (low P/E ratio + strong AI future).
Started betting on it with options.

What kind of bets?

They bought calls → basically betting the stock would go up.
Specifically, they bought 5% OTM calls 30 days out:
OTM (Out of the Money) = strike price a little above current stock price.
30 days out = options expiring in about a month.
On red days (when the stock dipped), they bought cheap calls.
When the stock went up and calls became profitable (in the money), they sold.
Then they used the profits to buy even more contracts → snowball effect.

The big move

Right before Labor Day, they had $450,000 in cash from previous trades.
They dumped it all into 220 strike calls (expiring Oct 17) when Google dipped to $207.
Those calls cost about $4.70 each, and they bought 950 contracts.
Next trading day → calls shot up in value.
They sold at $16 per contract → turning $450K into ~$1.5M.
ELI5 analogy

Imagine you think candy bars are going to get way more popular.

Instead of buying actual candy bars, you buy tickets that let you buy candy bars later at today’s price.
If candy bar prices rise, those tickets suddenly become super valuable.
You keep doing this: buy cheap tickets, sell when prices go up, use profits to buy more tickets.
One day, you put all your money into tickets, candy bars skyrocket, and boom → you’re rich.

⚠️ Important: This worked out here, but it’s incredibly risky. Most people lose everything doing this, because if the stock doesn’t move the way you want fast enough, the options expire worthless."

I’m not trying to be a hater I just really don’t want to see you lose money and I’m not sure you have a real strategy other than going in with a call when things go down enough. Do you trade supply and demand? Internal range LQ to External Range LQ? Any price action strategy? Do you use a reliable indicator strategy that’s been proven to work more times that it doesn’t? How is your risk management? Are you keeping losses low and wins high? 

Idk this looks a lot like luck so put your 1m in the bank and go back to roughly 10k and learn a real strategy and good risk management skills. I’m really happy for you and would hate to see you lose even a penny of it."

Yeah, risky but it is a way to in-essence buy the dip. I might do that if QQQ drops 15% from ATH. Still sucks waiting for 15% drop though. Prefer that we are done and just see a V recovery.

Positive catalysts:
- Trump keeps China meeting

- gov shutdown ending

post,r/investing,1o3d476,,1760130571,Gamingwishard,4214,545.0,BREAKING: Trump places 100% tariff on China starting Nov 1st,"The S&amp;P 500 falls 70+ points in seconds after President Trump publishes the below paragraph about China.

Donald J. Trump Truth Social Post 04:50 PM EST 10/10/25 

It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.

Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.

It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

DONALD J. TRUMP
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"

Mine is high, so I'm all in on NBIS, which is a risky play if you believe in the ""AI bubble"" that everyone is panicking about. Personally I don't buy the AI bubble shit. I believe this stock has a good chance to gain 100-200% or more in the next year because of the expertise of the people running the company and how they manage their finances. I'm already up 150% from when I first invested in them 5 months ago, and I'm not selling for the next 5 years unless I feel like their future outlook changes in a negative way. Obviously do your own research and don't just take my word for it. If you want to play it safe, buy VOO or bonds or keep all your money in a HYSA. I'd rather take a riskier approach with greater upside potential. Investing is inherently risky anyway.

Just wanted to share this milestone here cause I don't really talk about money with anyone IRL and my wife doesn't care LoL. My 401k had 286k in Sept 2023 and I have been contributing the max ever since. I just have it invested in the VTSAX equivalent. I can't believe it has almost doubled in just two years.

I mostly contributed up to the company match starting in 2006. I think I had around 10-12k during the 2008 recession. By 2011 I had around 40-45k. Then I was unemployed/student from 2011-2014 so I missed some bullish years. Went back to work in late 2014 and contributed to the company match again.

I maxed it out between 2017-2021. I think in 2019 I had around 90-100k. In 2022 I went back to just the company match cause I had another kid (that would have been the best time to max), then maxed it out again in 2023.

So for you young people out there, contribute as much as you can and it will grow faster than you can imagine."

Like, if you invested in the S&amp;P 500 right at the beginning of 2008 (the ""worst possible time"", due pretty quickly losing almost 50% in value) and then just sat on that money, you'd still be at nearly 6x your initial investment."

Don't forget about RMDs, though. While it's dumb to leave free money on the table a la the company match, having too large of a balance in your 401k or traditional IRA can cause a big tax headache when you're 75+ (currently 73)."

comment,r/investing,n8y3jps,t3_1mqsa1x,1755312974,TxTriMan,3,,,"Everyone should know the “Rule of 72”. Divide the compound rate of return you are making into 72 and that is approximately the number of your it will take to double your investment. Get 10%, then it will take ~7 years. Get 8% and you are looking at 9 years. This works best for retirement funds as taxes are not a factor. 

Max out your retirement account ever. If you itemize, then it is a deduction. Grows tax free.  

You are doing a great job. Also, remember a skipped year can never be recovered. When in seven years, you haven’t doubled this year’s contribution, then you will feel it. 

Good luck."

You can’t know the future, but it’s a good milestone pointing to being able to retire in your late 50’s or certainly on time with plenty of money to have a good retirement (depending on life style of course)."

comment,r/investing,n8zpvm6,t3_1mqsa1x,1755343732,[deleted],2,,,That’s good news. 34 been going through serious financial struggle but starting to turn corners.  Hoping I can max out and make up for lost time
comment,r/investing,n8zvurq,t3_1mqsa1x,1755346381,Nickel4me,2,,,"It’s nice to hear these stories. Mine is very similar!  I’m 45yrs old and my wife also doesn’t care too much about investing. She has me make all the financial decisions, I even pay all the bills out of our accounts.  My 401ks are at about $600K with another $250K in vested company stock, $250K in brokerage and another $90K or so in misc investments (annuities etc). So, I have close to $1.2M for retirement. My wife only has about $150K being 43yrs old.  

I only started maxing out each of our 401ks about 3-4yrs ago when we both changed jobs and almost doubled our HHI.  Before that, I only probably put half of each years max since my mid 20s, where she put in very little (when I wasn’t managing her stuff).  Now, our HHI is about $425K w/annual bonuses where we not only max our 401ks but we invest another $3K - 4K every month into our Schwab brokerage account.  

The only issue with all this is, my wife is starting to spend a lot more on the kids, unnecessary, and expensive stuff each month.  When I call it out, she right away wants me to stop her 401k investments. I’m like what!? Why?  I don’t want to not invest on her side (for her own good), but she gets stubborn. I’m at the point now that I just try my best to manage our spending to maintain my investment strategy for us. My goal is to invest $100K/yr (w/empl 401k match and brokerage investing).  Keep that up for the next 20yrs and I’m done at 65. Oh, and she doesn’t want to retire prior to early 60s either, even if we have the means to before then, says it’s a waste in her eyes. SMH.  I also feel we’re now considered behind because our HHI recently spiked, like we’re late bloomers.  Still grateful and very blessed though.

Great job staying the course OP! Good luck!"

63, From 25 to 50 I honestly didn’t look at it more than a glance. My point, if you are looking too hard, you will need discipline during a bull market. Some of you have not experienced that. Think of April this year for 3 years. It’s at that time you want to stay invested if not more. I didn’t look at it like I said so I don’t recall any anxiety during my bull market years but trust me, your $500k can and probably will go to $375k before it’s $1M. Stay the course and stop looking."

I hit 1 million at 50, 2 million at 60. 7% yearly was as good as I knew at the time. Retired at 62 with 2.2. am 65 and into VTSAX, FSK, VWUAX. got lucky having bought Nvidia at $10 for 1000 shares, stupidly sold at 110, because advisors valued the stock at $90. It'd be over 10x if I held. Bought Oracle at $4 so many years ago, bought AMD at $10, sold a week later at $110. 

I do have a bunch of my IRA in the standard retirement funds. We live of of one that is worth $500k and hasn't been reduced in the years of retirement and all the others are growing. 65 and net worth had grown to 3.2 million. My biggest mistake was putting to much into retirement funds and not enough into ROTH. Here is what I think you should do: 
1) calculate the top of the 12% tax bracket, married it's somewhere around $126.95k 
96,950 +30,000
2) always do the company match, but try not to put any of your income upto #1 amount into your 401k. Put in to reduce your yearly income to the #1 amount.
3) instead invest it personally, when you retire you live off this amount, and take the full 12% amount and roll it into your ROTH. You can write a check, pay the taxes (20%) add that 20% from your savings, and roll it all into your ROTH

I have about 1.8 million in IRAs, and I'm going to have a really hard time spending that without paying 22% taxes to gain access to it. I could have had alot of that in personal investments had I not been so aggressively adding to my 401k."

These products do not have any available alternatives in the short term that would even come close to requisite demand. 

If this is a long term strategic move by China, it is going to massive supply shortages and cost increases. A display monitor that now costs $500 may well be $1500 by same time next year.

Low tariffs are inflationary, but high tariffs are deflationary once you factor in the knock on impacts to labor and economic activity. See the great depression. This only ends when people undo this insanity.

Trump say tariffs, China says export controls.... All that means is less trade which reduces the economy of scale, reduces the need for labor. Labor reduction reduces consumption, reduced consumption leads to even less labor. GDP suffers and likely shrinks. Everyone suffers and for what? Ego? 

The global economy is leveraged up on low trade barriers and economies of scale. Unwinding that will undo all the benefits we gained from it. Where the old trend line is I don't know but we are going to find it if this crap continues and test it. That could be far below current price for equities and real estate. The only way out of this that isn't a disaster is for all parties to respect each others positions and reach a reasonable deal. 

The Trump administration has only two approaches. They compliment people when convenient and go scorched earth if anyone doesn't roll over and do what they are told. Democrats have no reason to trust them so no deal can be reached, only surrender or holding out until midterms. China has no reason to negotiate because it's clear the administration isn't giving but only taking. 

With all that considered I'm expecting this will get much worse before it gets better since the outcome is being determined by an old man with a mile high ego, thin skin, and a preference for revenge over burying the hatchet.

Two things, and I say this as a Trump voter:

1. China got into their world superpower position by playing the long game and taking full advantage of the Global Economy Rulebook that *we* (the West, not just the US) wrote. He who makes and supplies holds power, and China makes and supplies the world today.

2. We (the US) already tried a trade war and we lost. Overnight. Bigly. He who does not make nor supply holds no power, and we surrendered it all to China over the span of many decades. Trump merely demonstrated American Exceptionalism and Pax Americana is and was dead.

Both of which to say, the markets have priced Chinese geopoliticals in and Trump tariffs (which we will likely lose bigly again) not. Kick back, relax, and enjoy the new era that is Pax Sino.

Whenever you hear a snotty (and frustrated) European middlebrow presenting his stereotypes about Americans, he will often describe them as “uncultured,” “unintellectual,” and “poor in math” because, unlike his peers, Americans are not into equation drills and the constructions midbrows call “high culture”—like knowledge of Goethe’s inspirational (and central) trip to Italy, or familiarity with the Delft school of painting. 

Yet the person making these statements is likely to be addicted to his iPod, wear blue jeans, and use Microsoft Word to jot down his “cultural” statements on his PC, with some Google searches here and there interrupting his composition. 

🇺🇸Well, it so happens that America is currently far, far more creative than these nations of museumgoers and equation solvers. It is also far more tolerant of bottom-up tinkering and undirected trial and error. And globalization has allowed the United States to specialize in the creative aspect of things, the production of concepts and ideas, that is, the scalable part of the products, and, increasingly, by exporting jobs, separate the less scalable components and assign them to those happy to be paid by the hour. There is more money in designing a shoe than in actually making it: Nike, Dell, and Boeing can get paid for just thinking, organizing, and leveraging their know-how and ideas while subcontracted factories in developing countries do the grunt work and engineers in cultured and mathematical states do the noncreative technical grind.

Then we can maybe have a rational discussion on whether or not big deficits are really the end of the world. The hysterics about the US deficit have been going on my whole adult life. They put a deficit ticker in time square under president Regan for god sakes. With some notable exceptions (2001 when the balanced the budget) and 2008 when mortgages crashed, in that period of time the US economy,  businesses, science, technology and markets have mostly prospered.

Our economy is levered up on global trade with low trade barriers. Now we are raising barriers and likely to reduce global trade. That is being done to create domestic jobs, but it will likely result in more job losses(logistics) than gains(manufacturing).

Inflation will flip to deflation when economy finally tanks. Where that really sucks is that means a bunch of job losses and the availability of things will be reduced. 

Government shutdown is likely to go really long. Way longer than people expect. Trump has a my way or scorched earth approach to deals. I'm not sure how that can result in a deal with the democrats. 

Inequality is incredibly high. Basically at 1920s levels. I would bet that wont end well for a lot of people.   


Will the market crash? Probably, but it could be months or possibly years out. There are plenty of offramps to mitigate that or to spread the pain so it doesnt look like a crash. Either we will crash or see minimal returns for years while this plays out. 

Having said all that I'm not buying puts. I'm sitting in tlt and chilling. This situation will get resolved. Im willing to ride it out in tlt and move back into equities after the crash.

Now we are approaching 6-years, and still no validated test. Now why would that be, exactly??

Not only that, the method they used to push the case count was dropped as of 12/31/2021 for being inaccurate and unreliable. Of course it was! It was a non-validated test!! There was no pandemic. It was baseless tyranny under Trump 1.0 - the math and the facts tell us so."

comment,r/investing,npjyyfr,t3_1odry6n,1763498014,PrivateCapitalAccess,1,,,"The strange thing is — debt headlines always create panic, but long-term capital usually doesn’t respond emotionally. It simply reallocates.

Historically, when:
	•	public debt accelerates
	•	inflation stays stubborn
	•	job market softens
	•	geopolitical uncertainty rises
	•	and equities feel “priced for perfection”

…institutional investors shift toward real assets with intrinsic value rather than financial promises.

That includes:
	•	essential infrastructure
	•	land in stable jurisdictions
	•	income-producing real estate
	•	energy + logistics assets
	•	long-term projects with strong demand and limited supply

Not because these assets are exciting — but because they are decoupled from political cycles and inflation tends to work in their favor.

Every cycle feels unprecedented, but the response is often the same:
move part of the portfolio into assets that don’t require perfect macro conditions to perform.

The people who preserve wealth through uncertain periods usually don’t guess “where the economy goes.”
They position themselves where volatility matters the least."

In a letter to Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK-B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRK-B), [BRK-A](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRK-A)) [shareholders published on Monday](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov1025.pdf), the outgoing CEO announced that he would no longer write an annual letter or speak at the company's annual meeting.

Buffett's letter to Berkshire shareholders, [published in February](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf), was his 60th edition.

At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett ended the meeting by announcing his recommendation that the company's board support vice chair Greg Abel as his successor. The board [voted two days later](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/may0525.pdf) in line with Buffett's recommendation, and Abel is set to take the reins as CEO on Jan. 1, 2026.

""I will no longer be writing Berkshire’s annual report or talking endlessly at the annual meeting,"" Buffett wrote on Monday.

The big difference is that the companies today actually make money. Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta they all have real products, billions in profits, and millions of users. Think of Google Maps, YouTube, Windows, Office, Android, Instagram etc. These are all solid products with billions in profits and massive user bases. Can you replace them? No. Will they go away anytime soon? Also no. Even if the AI trend slows down, these companies still have strong foundations and cash flow from their non-AI products.

During the dot com bubble, most companies had no profits and were running on hype alone. Not to mention how technology wasn’t even a big part of people’s lives back then. Most people were just getting online for the first time, and the internet was still something new and weird, used mostly by nerds.

Sure, they existed before the bubble and the products you're listing are pre-AI products. Nobody is worried about those products. Except maybe Nvidia since while their product existed before, their volume and structure and valuation has tilted entirely towards the actual AI companies.

What people are worried about are (1) OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and every VC cash awash AI startup that _doesn't_ have profitable products and (2) the portion of the valuation of the preexisting companies attributable to the AI bubble.

I mean yeah, Kraft existed before the AI bubble and had products then. But if they started selling shitcoins in 2019 and their valuation tripled from blockchain hype alone, it's true that they had Mac &amp; Cheese before but maybe the new 60% of their stock price is at risk when that bubble pops. _At best_ they drop to pre-bubble levels but probably worse since they presumably diverted investment from the preexisting units into bubble projects and now they're behind on their core business.

Write your post again but instead of ""Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta"" say ""IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Compaq, Intel, Oracle"" and tell us again why that bubble won't be so bad.

I mean. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/nvidia-ceo-huang-s-outing-heats-up-korea-s-fried-chicken-stocks

&gt; Jensen Huang’s Midas touch extends to Korean fried chicken.

&gt; Photos and videos of Nvidia Corp.’s CEO having beers and fried chicken at a local restaurant, Kkanbu Chicken, in Seoul — with Samsung Electronics Co. Chair Jay Y Lee and Hyundai Motor Co. Executive Chair Chung Euisun — went viral, and now investors are driving up the stocks that may be a beneficiary.

&gt; While Kkanbu is not publicly listed, shares of rival Kyochon F&amp;B Co. briefly surged as much as 20% on Friday after photos and videos of the gathering circulated widely on social media. Korean poultry processor Cherrybro Co. also soared by the daily limit of 30%, with trading volume about 200 times its average. Neuromeka Co., a Kosdaq-listed company that makes chicken-frying robots, also jumped.

Does that seem _normal_ to you? Does the presence of pre-bubble fried chicken justify this?"

2. the height of dot com was when companies with no real profits got huge valuations. But many of the AI companies don't make money right now. If you are looking at Meta or Google, AI is costing them tons of money, not making it. So yea, Google isn't going anywhere, but the massive multiple given to them for a line of business that doesn't generate positive cashflow isn't exactly unlike 2008. The firm can survive and still get massive stock pullback.
3. The idea of a correction being more likely than a meltdown is not in anyway controversial. This administration seems hell bent on not allowing a crash despite any policy implications. And AI is likely to right size adoption profitably, just as e-commerce did eventually win the day for the leading companies of the 2000s."

You could say the same about Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, IBM, and many others in the 90's. There were lots of highly profitable tech companies.

The danger isn't that MSFT/Google/Nvidia/Meta will go bankrupt. The danger is the AI startups that are massively unprofitable, that are renting cloud capacity from the biggest tech companies. Most EPS growth from big tech comes  from cloud growth, renting out capacity.

There are some pretty stupid AI startups. From the tech bubble, at least pets.com provided a useful product to consumers, it was just unprofitable. There are some pretty useless AI startups like this one https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/ai-startup-friend-spent-more-than-1m-on-all-those-subway-ads/

The massive overbuild of capacity will result in lots of losses for cloud providers when demand from unprofitable startups wanes.

When tech is trading at 40-500x earnings, it doesn't take bankruptcy or even an earnings decline to produce a &gt;50% crash. It just takes earnings growing slower than previously anticipated.

Random thoughts below:

There's going to be a point where it contracts considerably and takes a lot of other economic growth with it. Right now, the entire U.S. economy is being propped up like a house of cards built on AI. Think about how much is actually being supported by AI expansion: data centers being built means construction and all of the infrastructure projects, like civil engineering, roads, power, cooling, materials, machinery, work crews, etc. People need to live close to their work, so there's probably a pretty good chunk of the real estate market that's people relocating for work. There's a LOT of stuff that's AI-related that isn't just AI. Eventually these construction projects will reach a saturation point where new construction slows dramatically and it becomes just maintenance with a little going into upgrading the existing facilities. 

When the ""bubble pops,"" it'll be some kind of cutthroat corporate warfare with the bigger, more successful companies swooping in and buying the little ones for pennies on the dollar. And a lot of it won't be because they're necessarily ""better""; they'll just have the capital in reserve to ride out the storm and wait for the little guys to run out of steam.

The main thing that concerns me is the whole ""AI taking our jobs"" thing. The main purpose of AI that's been promoted is to increase efficiency and eliminate human ""waste."" Once these jobs are eliminated, that's going to be a VERY significant segment of the workforce. If fewer people are working, that means fewer customers buying their services, which means less demand for AI, and so on. And a lot of these jobs won't be replaced; this includes the engineers and technicians who are the ones doing all of the ""heavy lifting"" right now.

I see a LOT of similarities to pyramid schemes, where the early investors benefit from whomever joins the game later until the market reaches a saturation point. If I was heavily invested (which I'm not), I'd keep my eye not on the stocks of the ""big guys"" themselves, but on little stuff like civil construction projects around the data centers and the land leases that are being made for new construction. As long as some podunk town in rural Idaho is hiring road construction crews and the city is selling land for data centers, there's still a good amount of growth going on. When those start slowing down, I'd think that's a good sign that there might be an overall slowdown coming. 

Of course, I probably have no idea what I'm talking about."

I think the risk is that this stuff doesn't work out, as in it replaces no significant number of people at their jobs, and that it's too expensive to be profitable. It would be relegated to a simple feature, like an assistive bot in MS Word.

In that case, people will question the money being spent on infra, and they'll stop spending it. There may be some investors losing their shirt at the whole trade unwinds. But the bigger deal is that we'll all be exposed to what the US GDP is like without that infra spending, which from reports, is near zero growth. Combine it with the 6%+ of GDP deficits that the US runs and it starts to look like really bad, like crisis of faith in the economy bad.

Some of the money being spent on AI infra would be repurposed for other business investment. But to what? Oil, which continues down in price? What's the next thing?"

And there were others like Microsoft and Intel that were profitable back then as well. 

It's like Nvidia is standing in for Cisco/Intel this time. There are so many circular deals where Nvidia has invested in various AI companies so that they can buy Nvidia GPUs.

The other potential threat is that someone like China will come up with much more efficient AI models that don't require the same level of computational horsepower - that would be bad for Nvidia (which could end up causing the crash) but ultimately good for AI. There are recent papers out there which discuss various approaches that could lead to this outcome.

There are plenty of investors blindly throwing money at projects that may very well become underutilized and even stranded assets both on the data center side and the accompanying power side within a few years.

The common result of all of these “crashes” is always that the companies mostly rebound in the long term because the businesses are not flawed. They are simply over valued right now.

With the exception of Nvidia and possibly oracle, they are not making profit from ai. AI is a loss leader. They have ai revenue not profit.
Only one member of the Magnificent Seven (outside of NVIDIA) has ever disclosed its AI revenue — Microsoft, which stopped reporting in January 2025, when it reported “$13 billion in annualized revenue,” so around $1.083 billion a month.  
From that 13 billion, 10 billion is from openAI azure usage, which they gave them at operational cost and they gave openAI a 10b loan. So outside of openAI they made 3 billions last year, that from a company that makes 27 billions a quarter.

I would say this bubble has more in common with the ""nifty fifty"" 1970s bubble though.

This is an example of the kind of short sightedness these quarterly profit reports cause. It even leads to higher ups “cashing in” the good will of a company for short term gains, while hurting the long term viability of that same company.

or to put it another way perception of a situation drifts over time and is recalibrated with the reports. The longer the time between reports the higher the risk that perception is far off base. That will either lead to a much higher level of volatility or a much lower price as people factor that additional risk into the price.

If you support this idea you are asking for the market to go down or for the market to have much higher volatility. That's fine provided everyone understands that otherwise you are changing the system in a way that will take advantage of people.


Europe basically uses the system proposed and the market has that priced into those markets. If you are a fan of that system perhaps invest in Europe? Oh, you don't like that idea? Then why try to turn us equities into something more like European equities?"

year.

The legal system and regulations (under the current administration) are unmatched in the world at focusing on creating growth. There are companies outside of the US that need to be owned (like TSMC), but it is challenging for Europe to keep up as they are held back by government policy. 

Japan is moving out of the dark ages and into the light and Korea is a solid competitive market -- these still have some legs. Germany has a new leader and is spending money on growth, but the unions are too strong to allow for good long term growth. 

EM has some opportunities. VietNam and some other huge SE Asia nations are well positioned. India has great demographics. There are many opportunities in EM and a strong and growing US will be a tailwind. 

All that said, it will be hard to compete with the US. With falling interest rates -- short term real rates are still high and huge corporate investments will motor the economy higher. The massive cuts to owernous regulations will help too. I think we are looking at north of 4% real economic growth in the US over the next 3 years. Nothing will keep u."

If you put everything in VTI and the tech market crashes 50% then you lose 50%. A diversified portfolio probably loses 20-30%. Yes the diversified portfolio only grossing at 8-13% vs the 20% VTI but it also loses much less in bear markets. The older you get the less time you have to earn it back so any advisor worth a shit is going to have you diversify cause no one knows when the next 50% tech crash is going to happen.

Almost no one here recommends 100% equities and 0% international diversification. No one says to buy once at market highs and never contribute again. I’m too lazy to do the math out but maybe someone will comment with it: what if the performance of someone who say started their career at 20yo in 1980 and contributed $200/mn or whatever for a 45 year career with dividends reinvested. Say they’re Japanese to heavy weight their market, like 70% Japan, 20% international and 10% bonds. Not sure career progress in Japan but maybe increase contributions by typical salary increase.





How long would this fairly average investor have been negative, if ever? Would this person be able to retire in Japan at age 65 considering the low inflation? My guess is most investors, besides those who retired between 1985-2000, turned out okay if they followed the fairly common investing advice and stayed diversified and stayed invested. The same is true for all the modern US crashes, those who DCA’d through out a career and stayed invested turned out fine."

""SCION ASSET MANAGEMENT®, LLC

October 27, 2025

Dear Investors,

With a heavy heart, I will liquidate the funds and return capital but for a small audit/tax holdback by year’s end.

My estimation of value in securities is not now, and has not been for some time, in sync with the markets.

With heartfelt thanks, but also with apologies, I wish you well in your future investments.

I do suggest investors contact my associate PM Phil Clifton regarding his coming endeavors. He can be reached at *~~removed~~* and at *~~removed~~*.

Phil is a tremendous young talent in the field of investment and the most prodigious thinker I have ever encountered.

Sincerely,  
**Michael Burry**  
Portfolio Manager""

On the other side, it’s hard to ignore the optics, regular investors don’t get that kind of break, and many sit on big unrealised gains wishing they could diversify tax-free too.

There are ~800,000 H-1B visa holders. These are not O-1 “extraordinary ability” visas, and it doesn’t block Indians from normal immigration. That’s about **0.22% of the U.S. population**, mostly low- to mid-level workers, who are apparently critical to post-WWII American tech dominance.

Google has 7,649 H-1Bs, $371.4B in revenue, and $74.9B in free cash flow. Covering its H-1Bs would cost $765M per year—**0.21% of revenue** or **1.15% of free cash flow**—for what’s being framed as the lynchpin of its operation.

The impact is larger for indian outsourcing mills like Cognizant, but I've never met anyone worried about protecting their margins.

Now assuming these H1B's were imported because the work couldn't be outsourced (which would've been cheaper) these jobs will go to Americans, which does have a partial feedback loop back to American companies. So it's not even clear if this is a net negative."

A top tech firm will not hesitate to pay this for that kind of person. A consulting firm won’t. So I think this will increase the ease with which top 0.01% talent gets in early career, and they’ll go to top companies and institutions only.

Put another way, the economic value (and profits) of getting someone who can cut it as a true software dev at Google or open ai or anthropic or Microsoft is in the many hundreds of thousands of dollars a year (above their salary and overhead cost). It consultants might only be 50-75k. This shifts more visas to a more profitable activity even with the 100k cost."

comment,r/investing,nfnmjc7,t3_1nlz8t7,1758570973,generallydisagree,1,,,"So to be clear, the Tech industry's claim is that the H1B Visas are vital to their future - it allows them to hire the best and brightest tech people in the world (not just from the USA).  

Now, an H1B visa spans 3 to 6 years - but can continue on for decades!  You see, if Microsoft hires the ""Best and Brightest"" from a foreign country on an H1B - the come for let's say the 6 year time period.  But if they then apply for permanent residency/green card status, or even other residency opportunities, their H1B is automatically extended while their application process (typically lasting many, many years) remains in place.  There are people who first came to the US for an H1B job 15 years ago - and remain employed as H1B employees to this day - even though the terms of their H1B has long expired (because that's how our system is set up and they are not part of the endless waiting line of having the status request processed, approved/denied, etc. . . ).

The next question is, if somebody is one of the best and brightest in the world of the tech industry - they are probably making tons of money.  So much money that a one-time fee of $100,000 upon hiring them as an H1B employee would be a drop in the bucket.  

Of course, if a tech company is claiming to hire a global best and brightest and pay them $75,000 per year - is that claim of best and brightest really legitimate?  Or are they just hiring that person at sub-standard wages (for the job type) to avoid paying somebody else (ie. an American) more?

India accounts for roughly 70% of H1B employment jobs in the USA.  The USA is not particularly pleased with India at the moment.  China accounts for about 13% of H1B jobs in the USA.  The USA is not particularly pleased with China at the moment.  The impact of H1B US-based employees sending money home to India is actually a pretty big deal.  As is their returning home with large winnings and starting their own tech-based businesses in India.  For China - how much of it is really about IP theft?  Between sending their ""kids"" to US colleges and getting US jobs in tech and other key industries - where China is coincidentally well known for IP theft . . . is the H1B jobs for Chines just a free entry to steel from the US tech sector?  And what else is at risk?

The US awards 65,000 standard H1B visas per year.  At $100K each, that's $6.5 billion.  Of course, the USA issues a LOT more than 65,000 H1B visas per year - these are the Cap Exempt category, and are for jobs in universities, not-for-profits, etc. . . there are more of these H1B visas issued each year than the 65,000 annually for the high skill job-set.  There is no limit on the number of these cap-exempt H1B visas."

post,r/investing,1nf46bi,,1757685961,OverwroughtPraise,1430,100.0,Is Oracle just SoftBank wearing a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

  1. AI is going to have a massive short term impact.
  2. AI is going to have no impact in the short term.

In case 1, everyone is happy; in case 2, we have a big crash. My guess is the most likely answer is, of course, somewhere in the middle. We're probably not at the top of the market, regardless if we have a bubble or not. Lots of analysts converge that opinion through high price targets.

Many future estimates of earnings have, to some extent, a revenue projection component without huge changes in margins for big tech. Now the s&amp;p is immensely concentrated into only a few companies that have circular revenue: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals

I think why people are so nervous is because the S&amp;P 500 concentrates into companies that have created inflated expectations. There are, of course, even more problems like dollar devaluation and the general state of the economy, so it's quite hard to find a safer place, especially in the short term. 

You park money in small cap? The economy is not so rosy. You park money in other sectors? Tarrifs. You park it in gold? Not that much physical utility of the metal.

The only places that seem reasonable to me for downturn protection are foreign currency and ex-US stocks, as well as reasonably valued companies. But institutions cannot move everything abroad, so tech giants are still a decent bet for many.

Anyway, that's just my take. Make of it what you will. As always, not everything is black and white.

TL;dr: I think we're screwed but VOO is not a bad place to park money in the short term while the market is dancing the twist."

I think traditional valuation models don’t hold the same weight they used to because investing is so prevalent among the average household now.

In a speech at European Parliament yesterday she urged to speed up Draghi's reforms and complete the single market. Further integration would boost the euro’s global role if coupled with rebuilding of hard power. She argues that the instability in US politics and markets has opened space for the EU to become a true global alternative.

The US dollar already weakened a lot, like 10% down since Trump took office. Lagarde said that the EU could move to replace the US dollar simply by speeding up reforms. 


- Rebuild Europe's hard power
- Speed up ever-closer Union
- Complete the Single Market
- New trade deals

None of the other major players will want to accept any of the others' though, so my guess is that they'll start moving toward a global reserve currency.

Similar actions were taken with major automakers during multiple past economic crises to stabilize key industries.  

The government involvement helps safeguard these sectors from undue foreign influence, a concern addressed through the Department of Defense’s Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) framework. The DoD provides resources and strategies to mitigate FOCI risks, ensuring that critical industries remain secure and aligned with U.S. interests.

Also I think British Leyland car manufacturer back in the 70's. 

In each of these cases it was done because the were collapsing and the consequences were seen as disastrous - the collapse of the bank would see loss of trust in the banking system and a run on the banks; I'm not sure if car manufacturing was seen as being a national security matter or if they just didn't want the job losses. 

It was seen as necessary to stop the collapse but the government didn't want to just hand out free money hence getting the ownership stake. I think Royal Bank of Scotland were sold on the market over a number of years (I think the government took a loss, not sure how big) and the British Leyland plants were eventually sold to Vauxhall and Rover.

Just wanted to put it out there to fellow investors. I got an email today from an industry newsletter. The White House has an upcoming direct-to-consumer drug purchasing program that they’re dubbing TrumpRX 😂. The news is Pfizer is the first company to jump into it and they’re discounting some of their drugs (still expensive though cuz they’re brand name) from 50-85% in exchange for being exempt from Trump’s tariffs on pharmaceuticals made abroad for the next 3 years.

Take that what you may in your investing decisions.

-Warren Buffett

Edit: more Buffett gems

“ We think any company that has an economist has one employee too many.”

“Something different happens all the time. And that's one reason economic predictions just don't enter into our decisions. Charlie Munger – my partner – and I in 54 years now never made a decision based on an economic prediction. We make business predictions about what individual businesses will do over time, and we compare that to what we had to pay for them. But we have never said yes to something because we thought the economy was gonna do well in the next year or two years. And we have never said no to anything because we were right in the middle of a panic… There's so many variables. I mean, in the hard sciences, you know that if an apple falls from a tree, that it isn't gonna change over the centuries because of anything or political developments or 400 other variables that go in. But when you get into economics, there's so many variables, and the truth is, you've got to expect good times and bad times in business.“"

Crypto is, by definition, pure bubble. Think about it:

Stock bubbles occur when people stop worrying about the fundamentals that drive valuation (earnings), and say ""whether it's justufied or not, I think it has momentum"". Which creates a self-fulfilling cycle that drives the price up. 

Sound familiar? With crypto, it's all bubble. The ""asset"" is a spreadsheet cell, imagined as a ""coin"", which does nothing. It does not confer ownership in any productive asset, or any kind of legal or voting rights.

I know this comes off as sour grapes, but it's still true. I have never said ""the crypto bubble can never reach $X"". Maybe there's enough greedy money and low enough ""gravity"" in finance that btc gets to a million per, idk.

But I'm never touching it. Structurally, once you see that it's just a tech-branded spin on old schemes like the ""airplane game"", I just have no interest. 

So is the S&amp;P500 a bubble? P/E of 40? yeah I guess but I'm not going to worry about that when the market tolerates an asset class where the P/E is by definition always infinity, but also isn't a commodity."

I’ve been riding gold, AI and a German Arms Manufacture for that last few months and have done ok. To me it suggests something wicked this way comes. 

I worked through the Dot Com Boom (for AOL even, but not by choice) and 2008- and both crashes were proceeded by “this isn’t overpriced it’s new territory” and encouraging retail to get in on the boom at the top (so holders could cash out before the fall) 

Gold was especially hyped in 2008, I wasn’t on the market then- but there were non stop gold commercials on the radio. We buy gold! Buy gold from us!"

It might go green, but this market has a long ways to go down once people get truly exhausted and stop buying the dip.

Give us a much bigger correction and perhaps the folks in charge will get together and take these issues seriously. Until then you are rubber stamping this bs.

Google is not just AI.

Microsoft is not just AI.

Broadcom is not just AI.

Tesla is trash, so fair call out.

Point is the vast majority of these companies have SIGNIFICANT cash flows and can afford the called they are spending.

If we assume they are the experts in their fields (and we aren’t, at least not to the extent they are), we should at least give them the benefit of the doubt, right?

Also, if you do the analysis, on say Google for example….they only need something like a 17% IRR for their AI capex to be cash flow accretive.

Lastly…the terminology “bubble” ASSUMES that these stocks will crash down 50% or more with no clear path back out of the red.

Does ANYONE really think Microsoft or Google are going to crash to that extent? And even if they do, not be able to recover?

These are dominant businesses. This is not a bubble. Are we over our skies? Yes. But bubble is just too harsh of a term by far."

Supply and demand.

Its only a bubble. If you prepare too much for demand and just keep stacking supplies because what if.. thats not the case here, there is an extreme demand at the moment, thats why you see some companies rising, even skyrocketing.
If there is supply but software solutions make money, it has always done so.  And those softwares need hardware to run. So i dont get what you guys who think ai is a bubble actually know, but i've never heard a tech expert say that there is a market bubble."

Anyone who has worked at a Fortune 500 company knows the company puts a ton of money time and resources into the quarterly reports themselves, and also drives so many decisions to be able to make positive statements by the time of the next report. Increasing that time would reduce those costs and allow a very slightly longer range view. Being publicly traded makes it hard to avoid the real issue though which is that short term profits are the only thing that matter because if you build a strong case for why you’re slowly building to 10 years from now, you might get a crazy PE like tech stocks or investors might all just run away to a company they think will have more meaningful gains now"

The Trade Act of 1974 is a U.S. law that promoted fair trade, created ""fast track"" authority for the President to negotiate trade agreements, and gave the government the power to respond to unfair foreign trade practices. Its most well-known provision is Section 301, which allows the President to enforce trade agreements by imposing sanctions, such as tariffs, on countries that violate agreements or engage in unfair trade. The act was signed into law by President Gerald Ford with the goal of stimulating economic growth and fostering competition."

Dennis: Well, no, but if we just re-distribute these, people will continue to drink for free.

Mac: Okay...

Dennis: How does this work, Mac?

Mac: The money keeps moving in a circle.

Dennis: But we don't have any money. All we have is this. ... How does this work, dude!?

comment,r/StockMarket,ngkcmyk,t3_1ns1mot,1759016675,Prestigious_Bet_2184,8,,,"Think of it like a **mini economy**.

* NVIDIA has chips.
* Oracle has data centers (built using NVIDIA chips).
* OpenAI needs those chips through Oracle’s cloud to train AI.

Instead of OpenAI going to banks or new investors (which would be expensive and slow), NVIDIA directly funds OpenAI. That way, OpenAI can immediately buy compute from Oracle. Oracle then naturally needs to buy more NVIDIA chips to meet that demand.

So NVIDIA is kind of **fronting the money** to grow the market it already dominates.

  
It’s not about whether NVIDIA, Oracle, and OpenAI are just passing money around.

The real question is: **Will there be enough outside demand (people and companies using AI products) to justify all this?**

If yes → everyone wins:

* OpenAI gets cheap funding.
* Oracle sells cloud capacity.
* NVIDIA sells chips.

If no → it looks like they just inflated numbers and financed each other without real demand.

Simple Analogy:

* A farmer (NVIDIA) gives money to a chef (OpenAI).
* The chef spends that money at a restaurant (Oracle) to cook meals.
* The restaurant then buys more food from the farmer.

If **customers keep coming to eat the meals**, it works brilliantly.

If not, it just looks like the farmer paid himself in circles.

This is **a smart shortcut** to fund AI growth without relying on banks or slow investors. It only works if **real people and businesses keep demanding AI services.**"

The whole 'you better watch out and cover your ass before it gets handed to you because we're in a massive bubble and it's about to pop any second' mindset spouted by everyone here on Reddit is tired and frankly just getting old.

The solution is pretty simple. If you think we're in a bubble and you're scared to have your money in the stock market, sell what you have and put it in something else like a HYSA, eat the falling interest rates, deal with your capital gains (if you have them) in April and move on with life. If you don't want to do that, stop bitching about a bubble on Reddit and maybe set stop losses or hedge or have a solid plan if there's a downturn. Have an emergency fund on the side if you don't want to get out of the market. Maybe don't YOLO if your risk tolerance or life circumstances can't handle it. It's seriously really pretty basic.

The whole, 'but the AI bubble...but the quantum bubble, but the...but the...' it's all just an echo chamber in these subs with a bunch of scared people who either want to scare others to sell to make themselves feel better and internalize or justify their inaction as they watch other people around them actively invested in AI or quantum or whatever continue to post their gains while they sit on the sidelines.

This is how a kleptocrat mafia state runs. You know, like Russia run under Putin and his oligarch pals. People warned everyone who Trump is, many didn't listen. Maybe getting it now. ARGH.

📌 kleptocracy—a system in which political leaders use state power to enrich themselves and their loyal associates through corruption and crony capitalism. 

This consolidation of wealth and power relies on appointing close associates to key state positions, granting lucrative deals, and controlling the judiciary, effectively merging the interests of state and private property for personal gain.

“Kleptocracy” is frequently used to characterize modern Russia because corruption is central to how the government functions, rewarding loyalty to Putin and the Kremlin with wealth taken from public resources. 

In Russia oligarchs are often also politicians (“poligarchs”), operating under direct Kremlin control, with their fortunes and influence contingent upon their loyalty to Putin. The lack of independent market institutions and an autonomous judiciary further supports this kleptocratic system."

It started with Blaze. Blaze was a flashy influencer with rented cars and rented confidence. One week he flooded everyone’s feed with a “secret” called the Wealth Key. Vague digital asset, membership, access, “100x potential,” all wrapped in neon charts and hype. No clear explanation of how it actually made money.

Nobody understood it. They bought anyway.

The first buyers slapped the charge on credit cards and posted screenshots like they had just hacked the system. Within a month, a big chunk of Prosperton had thrown rent money, grocery money and bill money into Wealth Keys.

On the surface, life looked normal. Underneath, people started paying everything late. “I will catch up when this hits.” Car repairs got ignored. Minimum payments became a lifestyle. Blaze bragged about “huge money committed,” and a whole ecosystem spun up around him. Paid private chats, paid coaching groups, paid “education” about a project none of them could explain in one sentence.

At the local bank, Clara watched everything melt in spreadsheets. Savings accounts emptied straight into Blaze’s processor. Credit card balances spiked. Late payments ticked up. From her screen, Prosperton stopped looking like a town and started looking like a casino.

Then the real damage hit.

A factory that had been there for decades came in for a loan to replace worn out machines. Real products. Real jobs. Real profit. They were solid. But the bank’s risk model now flagged Prosperton as a hot mess full of overleveraged gamblers. Head office priced the factory’s loan like a bad bet. The rate would choke them. Clara ran the numbers twice, then had to say no.

Two months later, the factory laid off a third of its workers.

That same week, Blaze vanished. Site down. Accounts wiped. Support email bouncing. Dashboards frozen, then blank. The “temporary sacrifice” everyone made never came back. The rent, the tires, the cards, all still very real.

Prices in town climbed. The diner raised costs. The mechanic raised rates. Landlords raised rent. Not because they were evil, but because their own financing had gotten more expensive in a “high risk” town. People who never touched a Wealth Key woke up paying for it anyway.

One night Clara walked past a pawn shop and saw the wreckage piled in the corner. Ring lights, monitors, microphones and hoodies with “Wealth Key Founders Club” on the chest.

She rented a cheap room above a laundromat and hung a handwritten sign: “How money actually works. Free.”

A handful of broke, angry and embarrassed people showed up. Clara wrote one sentence on a whiteboard:

“If you do not understand how it makes money, you are the product.”

Then she wrote:

“When enough people are reckless at the same time, it stops being personal and becomes the economy.”

That is the point.

Stupid financial decisions are not isolated. When enough people throw survival money at hype and refuse to ask basic questions, they do not just wreck their own lives. They raise your rent, kill your job, and make your loans more expensive, even if you did everything right."

Key Points

* A looming federal government shutdown appeared even more likely after top Democrats and Republicans met with President Donald Trump at the White House.
* “I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing,” Vice President JD Vance said after the meeting.

A looming federal government shutdown appeared even more likely after top Democrats and Republicans met with President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) at the White House on Monday.

“I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing,” Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.cnbc.com/jd-vance-us-vice-president/) told reporters after the meeting, which came less than two days before the shutdown will begin in the absence of a funding deal.

The Democratic participants, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, likewise suggested that the two sides remain far apart.

“We have very large differences,” Schumer said after the meeting. But he added that he believes Trump heard Democrats’ objections “for the first time,” suggesting the face-to-face was at least partially constructive.

Both sides continued to assert that the other would be to blame if the government does shut down starting Wednesday.

“It’s up to the Republicans whether they want to shut down or not,” Schumer said.

He also stated that a shutdown would be ""a tremendously negative mark on the President of the United States. He's the one that has to get people together"".

post,r/StockMarket,1okl9c1,,1761884579,-----Marcel-----,2916,740.0,"Stock Market Crash ""Hindenburg Omen"" Triggered 🚨 The Hindenburg Omen, an indicator that correctly detected the 1987 and 2008 stock market crashes, has been triggered!","Explanation:

""The Hindenburg Omen is a combination of technical signals that together forecast the likelihood of a stock market crash.  The technical inputs are the 10 Week Simple Moving Average, New 52 week highs on the NYSE, New 52 Week lows on the NYSE, and the McClellan Oscillator.

If, on the same day,

 a) the 10 Week Moving Average is rising,
 b) New Highs and New Lows are greater than [2.2]% of total issues traded, 
 c) the McClellan Oscillator is negative, and
 d) New Highs are less than or equal to twice the New Lows

then a Hindenburg Signal is indicated by a yellow circle. 

Two such signals within a 36-day period is considered a Hindenburg Omen and is indicated by a red diamond. The Hindenburg Omen portends a serious decline within the next 40 days."""

Been through 2000 tech bubble, the 2006 housing mortgage meltdown, Covid Crash and a whole bunch of other crashes.

I’m 61 now and getting ready to retire. Crashes come and go but if you try to time the market or get greedy that’s when bad things happen. Start young and invest as early as possible in SP500 or Nasdaq 100 indexes  to spread out the risk. Let compound interest work for you.

So please don’t panic. If you’ve properly allocated your funds you’ll be fine in the long run. My first investment in 1984 was $250 in a mutual fund mirroring the SP500 and every month I’ll add $50 and reinvest the dividends. As I started working I increased my monthly automatic contributions. It’s done very well for me.

The stock market has done very well for me. I’ve had a nice career doing what I love. So good luck to all and don’t let the fear mongering cause you to make bad financial decisions."

post,r/StockMarket,1nuxkuh,,1759288972,TACO_Orange_3098,2818,478.0,U.S. government will shut down after midnight as Congress fails to pass funding bills,"**"" I am posting this at 11:22pm EST ............... see where we are in the morning i guess ""**



[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/government-shutdown-live-updates.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/government-shutdown-live-updates.html)

  
Key Points

* House Speaker Mike Johnson blasted Democrats for holding out against passing a stopgap funding bill that would avoid a shutdown of the U.S. government at the end of the day.
* “They “need to come to their senses here, and do the right thing,” Johnson, R-La., said during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”
* Jeffries, in his own interview on “Squawk Box,” said of Republicans, “If the government shuts down, it’s their decision to do it.”

The U.S. government will [shut down](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/trump-meeting-democrats-government-shutdown.html) just after midnight on Wednesday after [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) failed to pass stopgap funding bills.

[Republicans](https://www.cnbc.com/republicans/) and [Democrats](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/trump-health-government-shutdown-jeffries-schumer.html) refused to budge from their opposing positions on a funding deal to avoid a shutdown. A key sticking point was Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced [Affordable Care Act](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/government-shutdown-healthcare-democrats-republicans.html) tax credits in any stopgap funding bill.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought sent a memo to the heads of executive departments and agencies on Tuesday night instructing them to “execute their plans for an orderly shutdown.”

Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat who broke ranks with most of the rest of his party’s caucus to support a Republican stopgap funding bill Tuesday, said, “It’s a sad day for our nation.”

**“Our government shuts down at midnight,” Fetterman said in a statement.**

If one party doesn’t have the votes, refuses to negotiate on a budget, and wants to force through a continuing resolution, then that’s on them.

Reciprocity is the only way to teach them the lessons in this high-stakes game theory exercise. The last time negotiation were had, the Republicans just clawed back all budgeted funds outside of their priorities. It’s faithless. Now the largest concern is whether the job reports and macro economic info will be able to go out on time, and if the OMB under Vought will go ahead and try enact further workforce reductions. I wonder if the market will keep irrationally go higher in absence of any stark hard data and mirages of consecutive fed rate cuts.

But due to insufficient points, the thread didn't allow me to make a post within a subreddit.

I am seeking general advice related to investment plans and the effect current situations will have on the market.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve been putting money into a mix of index funds and ETFs. It’s added up to a decent amount, and a few of my index fund positions are up around 70–75%, which I’m really happy about.

With all the recent talk about a possible market downturn, I’ve been wondering if it might be smart to take some profits now. My idea is to pull out the gains, leave the original investment untouched, and then reinvest the profits if the market dips.

On the other hand, I know timing the market isn’t easy, and maybe it’s better to just stay put and ride it out.

Would really appreciate hearing how others are approaching this."

post,r/options,1o7prtk,,1760568613,PandaMcGee3,1740,117.0,My method on making money trading mispriced options with AI,"TLDR: Find stocks with abnormal volatility skews using AI, then trade Vertical Spreads on them depending on the direction. 

I've been trading options for about 3 years now. For basically all of that time, I was essentially gambling. Buying cheap calls cus i saw some shit on reddit or twitter, then praying and hoping for 10x returns.  Lost money, made some back, lost it again. The usual retail trader shit. 

About 6 months ago I got tired of the guess flow and decided to actually learn the math behind options pricing. Slowly I began to build my strategy and with the help of AI I can confidently say that I am getting pretty profitable now. More importantly though, I finally feel like I have a decent understanding behind the options market. 

This is a post I wish I had when I began my journey trading options, it mainly covers the strategy I currently employ but also covers some of the more basic concepts as well. Feel free to skip sections if you are more experienced. 

# 1. What is a volatility skew (and why does it exist)

Think of options pricing like Vegas setting NBA Finals odds. Bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. Options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the Black-Scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality.

Here's the key: **Black-Scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.

**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.

**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic buying puts or FOMO'ing into calls, you get an abnormally rich skew. That's what we're hunting for

[SPY's actual volatility skew vs Black-Scholes, u can see that far OTM options are way more expensive than theory predicts](https://preview.redd.it/63asxmkkmcvf1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63752679f5b11a3385943891529bd4e7c3e0d452)

# 2. How to find options with rich skews?

Not all skew is created equal, as i mentioned earlier, most skews are totally normal and are usually well priced. The key is having a system / criteria that helps you identify richer/abnormal skews more consistently. 

**Note: before you start prompting the AI, you wanna make sure that it has real upto date market info.** To do this either use one with the market data plugged in like Xynth, or download it from TradingView or polygon and then upload the CSVs to ChatGPT or Claude, either method should work. 

Here’s how I look for them 

**A) Skew Z-Score Below -2.0**

* This compares current skew to the stock's historical average. A z-score of -2.0 means the skew is 2 standard deviations steeper than normal, statistically rare and more likely to revert. In simple terms: how outta pocket is the current pricing of the current chain compared to historical averages

https://preview.redd.it/awwiwg09ocvf1.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3bea4f68cee95f90bfce8590991858a04800741

**B) IV/RV Mismatch**

Compare the current IV vs the RV, realized volatility ie, what the market thinks the stock will do vs what it has been doing lately:

* **OTM strikes:** IV should be significantly HIGHER than realized vol → overpriced
* **ATM strike:** IV should be equal or LOWER than realized vol → fairly priced

When both conditions hit, you've got one option that's expensive and one that's cheap. That's your spread.

https://preview.redd.it/llqqmwufqcvf1.png?width=1594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7203789dabca99e805711a9ff2f55d36a56c9a35

**C) Momentum Confirmation**

This tells you which direction to trade:

* **Positive momentum + call skew** → Buy call spread (buy ATM, sell OTM call)
* **Negative momentum + put skew** → Buy put spread (buy ATM, sell OTM put)

https://preview.redd.it/gpijsbnuqcvf1.png?width=1592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80865a05d5f9f6b0f2fa21a1e918aa3e552288f7

# 3. The Trade: Vertical Spread

Once you've identified rich skew, here's how what you wanna setup, i mainly only do bull spreads cus i dont like shorting but is suppose you can try the opposite just as well:

* **Buy the ATM option (fairly priced, \~50 delta)**
* **Sell the OTM option (overpriced, \~10-25 delta)**

https://preview.redd.it/v30wttkcrcvf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53cb57bd141bb2a9a207d8f73a2049a62bceacc4

[These visuals are examples from my Xynth chat. In this particular trade, the score was only 68\/100 mainly because the ATM option was already overpriced, so the spread doesn't give us much profit potential. Nonetheless, the concept remains the same. Feel free to adjust the variables in the prompts and expand the scope to run this scanner daily or even hourly on many more stocks.](https://preview.redd.it/o5jua1vfrcvf1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d380bae0bb9a98500e6eec6bd6c3e1cfb766cb4)

# 4. Why Vertical Spreads?

If you've read this far then you probably realized that the point of this strategy isn't purely directional but rather a relative value play, which is a fancy way of saying **you're buying something cheap and selling something expensive at the same time.**

You're not just betting the stock goes up or down. You're betting that the pricing relationship between two options is out of whack, and it'll normalize. 

Plus, if the stock does something crazy, your long option protects you. You're not exposed to infinite risk on either side.

# 5. Results

I've been running this strategy for about 2 months now, so take these numbers with a grain of salt, it's still early.

**Current stats:**

* Win rate: \~38%
* Average return per winning trade: \~250%
* Average loss per losing trade: \~60%
* Net: Still up overall despite losing more trades than I win

The nature of this strategy is asymmetric.  I've had trades return 300-400% in a couple weeks, and I've had trades lose 50-70% just as fast. But winning 4 out of 10 trades at 3-4x return covers the 6 losses easily.

Just for fun I plugged your winrate, avg return %, and avg loss % into my little spreadsheet I use to calculate a bunch of metrics for options strategies. Just like you said, take these with a grain of salt, because if your winrate is off by even 10% (e.g. true winrate of 28%) then these would be completely wrong. But assuming your stats ARE correct, just as a thought experiment:

Implied probability 19% (this is the probability of avg trade winning if the market were perfectly efficient; you must have a greater winrate than this assuming return and loss % are accurate)

Per trade Sharpe: \~0.38

Annual sharpe if 50 trades a year: \~2.72 (50 trades a year = 1 trade a week; &gt;2 is great)

Annual sharpe if 25 trades a year: \~1.92 (25 trades a year = 1 trade every 2 weeks; still great)

Kelly fraction: 23% of bankroll (mathematically perfect amount of your bankroll to bet in order to maximize your geometric growth over time)

Geometric growth if betting full kelly: 10% each trade

If you made 25 trades a year and geo growth was truly a trustworthy number (its not), your CAGR would be 1083%

Avg total portfolio return each time you win, assuming bet 23% of portfolio: 75%

As you can see, the metrics above are insanely optimistic. This tells me that your winrate is probably inflated a lot by the current exuberant regime we are in. But don't take that as a diss on your strategy; rather, be cognizant of market headwinds. My advice: size small, and keep running this until the momentum of the overall tech boom fizzles out."

comment,r/options,njpdt00,t3_1o7prtk,1760569471,AppearsInvisible,8,,,"""You're not just betting the stock goes up or down. You're betting that the pricing relationship between two options is out of whack, and it'll normalize.""

That sums up the idea quite nicely.

It's also interesting that you're seeing a low win rate but overall profitability in your results. As you said, it's early on the results side of things, but I find it intriguing in terms of psychology as well. I notice that most traders seem to gravitate toward high win rate over high rewards. I suppose it is going to vary with the individual but I can certainly see how the large wins would make up for not just the monetary losses but also the mental hit of setting up a losing trade. It might be hard for a less experienced trader to appreciate the subtle difference here between gambling results that also have high risk/reward compared to having a thesis for this skew setup.

There are quant nerds working around the clock on Wall Street and beyond.

Summary: Interest rates (IR), the Consumer Price Index (CPI), commodities, and even the President’s decisions all impact two key areas: FX and bonds. These, in turn, influence the futures market, which sets the direction for the day for indices, equities, and related instruments.

Attempting to use AI to trade equity options without considering the macro-to-intermediate derivative layers of the market is misguided, because equities and their options are downstream in this multi-quadrillion-dollar financial system.

* **Negative momentum + put skew** → Buy put spread (buy ATM, sell OTM put)

If you have put skew and bearish, wouldn't a bear call spread make you more money? Call are dropping in value and not retaining premium so you'll retain more of the profit from your short option. Or are you doing this trade because you have determined the OTM option is overpriced thus you want to be on any trade that exploits that reverting?

Or say there is put skew but you are bullish...in this case your only option is a bull call spread because a bull put spread would make you buy an expensive put that's otm. I'm guessing in this case you wouldn't put on the trade at all because your post is about exploiting prices and there's nothing to exploit on the call side if you have put skew."

I received confirmation that my position was closed and I profited 4.45k. Later in the day after session was closed, I received a message from Robinhood that my closed profits has been retracted due to an exchange error and I not only lost my profits but also lost the right to close my SPX contract before end of session. Has anyone experienced this before? If I had known they were going to were going to cancel my closed position, I could have take  profits throughout the day as my contract ran up to over 45.00.

When your order was filled, it seems the CBOE was having issues.  There was a failure from OPRA (Option price reporting authority on that day which caused a lot of issues, not only with the CBOE but other exchanges as well).  At the time your trade occurred, quotes were all over the place, including no quotes, no offers and prices that varied a lot.

Under pre approved rules, the CBOE can bust a trade if it is an ""obvious error""  There are steps and time limits involved.  They will then notify RH.  These type of busts happen more than you might think.  It sucks that you, the customer has to suffer vs the exchange, OPRA, or other parties involved,  You did nothing wrong.

Your complaint here which I think you will get the best result, is the length of time it took them to notify you.  If the bust was posted in time and sales at 10:58 pt, you should have been notified long before the close of trading.  Either the CBOE notified RH late or RH notified you late.  If you file a complaint with FINRA, you should reference this time lag.

Edit to add,

Here is the CBOE Rulebook.  Rule 6.5 starting on page 409 discusses when they can bust a trade.

So the answer to your question is no. You got robbed by CBOE, not Robinhood. Still bullshit though. Your put definitely wasn’t worth $50 at that time sure.

But it wasn’t THAT much of an erroneous crazy price for them to bust that trade like if you got filled at $100+ or something in my opinion. Whoever messed up and bought that for $50 that’s their fault they should have to take the loss in this case imo.

Robinhood never reached out to me to offer any explanation until 3:55p EST via email. According to them, they didn’t get notified by CBOE abt the busted trade until 3:14p EST."

And no compensation from the brokerage, despite the fact that he was notified after trading hours.  The crux of the discussion was around the fact that he got out of his legs individually (because volatility was so high, he was having trouble closing the spread/IC and apparently that helped precipitate the issue).

  
Note to all, if you are panic trading in high volatility, do not leg out of your spreads, as it greatly increases risk of busted trade.  Or at least that was my takeaway."

comment,r/options,nlw5rnt,t3_1oijp3w,1761684089,trade_thriving,26,,,"Nice run but honestly I'm skeptical about those March '26 calls. I've been trading SPY options for years and holding that far out feels risky, especially with all the macro stuff you mentioned. I mean the Trump-Xi meeting could go either way - I remember similar hype in 2018 that didn't pan out. And banking on permanent deals seems optimistic tbh. I've been burned before assuming political meetings would move markets long term. The delta on those 790s has gotta be pretty low right now too. I personally would've taken some profits and maybe rolled shorter dated, but that's just me. What's your plan if the China talks don't go as expected?"

comment,r/options,nmce068,t3_1oijp3w,1761904487,dj0726,1,,,"Admirable gains. I hope people don't conclude that outcomes determine whether something is a good trade. A good trade results from a process that locates edges of advantage that tilt the probability of winning slightly in the investor favor. Alot of good trades lose money. Alot of silly trades do quite well. This was a lucky bet. Along w/ anyone that bought the dip on April 9th. Our odds were half chance. I happen to be in your camp, I did quite a bit of buying at the lows, but in hindsight it worked out far better than what at the time was my base case or best case expectation for the next 6 months. Which reminds me. I had an unforgettable due diligence call w/ the head of E-Trade's investor relations team about 10y back. This was before they sold to Morgan Stanley. He explained to me that every retail trading account in their system had a decay rate and an expected life. In other words, all of their customers would eventually lose all their money, and so they had to reinvest a significant amount of capital into ads and promotions to find new traders and replace the accounts that would invariably lose all their money. Thankfully E-Trade's trove of marketing spend gave us the E-Trade baby, one of the best ad campaigns of all time. But the lasting lesson I took from that exchange is that ""trading"", the way that retail investors use the term, is just a casino. An institutional trader's job is not to guess market direction and timing. They make markets, they profit from the bid / ask within fixed income &amp; derivatives, or they pocket commission in the equity market. Even proprietary trading in the classical sense done at the large trading houses is anchored in the basic function of having capital, lots of capital, to provide liquidity at bid / ask. That's the lion's share of the P&amp;L, and it's why the GSs and Jane Streets of the world post black every quarter. Every once in a while they make a boat load when volatility allows for it. Congrats on those calls though, fantastic outcome."

post,r/options,1n57bv2,,1756677489,RdyPdy,627,192.0,Results after 1 month auto-trading options (~$150k account),"Results recap after my first full month bot trading options with live accounts - approximately 7% return on allocated capital.

Ive been options trading manually for over 5 years and have run many paper trade bots. I finally decided to go hard with live accounts on strategies that paper traded very well.

Primary strategies are iron condors on SP index sectors, ORB iron butterflies (1DTE), ORB calls/puts depending on direction of breakout on QQQ. I try to stay delta neutral on the non ORB strategies

Currently about $150k allocated to these bots but not all are currently trading due to low IV environment. 

So far very happy with results and in September I hope to increase return on risk closer to 20%. Im fine if win rate drops to get there as my goal return on risk is 25%. 

Happy to answer questions or share more specific analytics"

post,r/options,1nmp95o,,1758453203,OptionsJive,497,190.0,1 in 6 Tastytrade customers go to zero,"Tom Sosnoff just dropped a stat in The Compound interview that floored me: 16% of Tastytrade customers blow up their accounts.

Think about that. Almost 1 in 6 people who come in full of excitement… end up at zero. And it's only because of SIZE. That's the one thing that kills even the geniuses in this business.

This is exactly why you must trade small and always have a Black Swan Hedge running in the background.

Most traders obsess over daily PnL, but the pros obsess over staying alive long enough to let compounding do its job.

I can't stress this enough: you don't blow up because you're dumb. You blow up because you think you're invincible, and the market always punishes that.

How many of you here are actually running a Black Swan Hedge vs. just ""trading small""?"

Also, I like Tom Sosnoff, but I dont agree with ""people stop trading because their accounts go to zero"". Some people (hopefully) stop trading because they realize it's not for them and stop BEFORE they go to zero

or

they stop trading and start investing. Which, at least in my opinions, are two different things."

comment,r/options,nfej1r5,t3_1nmp95o,1758455317,PckMan,11,,,"I've been at this for a few years now and have had multiple ""runs"". Some ended simply because I withdrew the money. I wanted it and I took it out. Some did indeed end with blown accounts. I made a fair amount of money and lost a fair amount of money. In almost all cases I generally had great performance but then one bad day would spiral into 0. Having a decent win/loss ratio means nothing if it only takes a handful of huge losses to undo all your wins. 

But I was learning, I was improving, and I did realise that I was leaving myself too vulnerable by having too little money on the line. I thought that was the smart choice to minimize risk, and I guess it was when I was new because early on I did blow more money than I should have because I got too excited too quickly. But in the interim between being a complete noob and now I was wondering why I was having trouble moving forward and growing. I'd have a few good months of rather rapid but consistent growth and then a few bad trades would push me back months and I'd have to start from scratch again. I stopped blowing accounts down to zero but at the same time I was pretty much going flat with a wide range, often ending up at my initial deposit and working it back up again. 

Lately I've been trying a new approach and it's been working out great so far, and while it hasn't been going on too long just by virtue of having proper hedges I know that it's very unlikely that I'll blow it again because that would mean I'd have to make multiple bad decisions in a row. The trick? I simply went in with more money. I diversified my approach and became more selective about which trades I take. That means that no one move going bad has the capacity to blow the account. And the more I progress the more money gets skimmed and invested in a safer manner, starting off with a third of the portfolio in stable investments and now having half of it in stable investments. Then the remaining half is also split between CSPs/CCs and bought calls/options. Limiting position size and diversifying my exposure, which is just  basic stuff that everyone tells you from the start, are enabling me to make better progress and ultimately take more risk because it limits my downsize potential.

I though that playing it safe was starting small and growing it fast to be able to take more risk with ""house money"", but that just leads to going in circles."

I”m disappointed because he knows few things in life are normally distributed and esp in the monetary world (e.g. see income distributions or option pricing skew).   Also he is mostly straight shooter in saying there is no tastytrading true edge (as in alpha), there is only a “mechanical” edge in things such as low slippage (e.g. only trade low bid/ask spreads and cheap commissions), frequent trades (“trade often” for law of large numbers effect), lowered stress (i.e. high occurrences of success), longevity (low capital at risk “trade small”) etc."

He needs to quote the median return and the mean return, and we will know that they are both underperforming the buy and hold, and potentially the risk free rate by vast amounts.

Better yet, just give us a histogram by 5% annual return buckets.

One thing I have learned is that the trader that progressions is the trader that has “0” excuses left.
When I first started trading; I lost it all but even more important I blamed for the reason I lost it all.
Then my second go at it; I started changing by asking my self “what did you learn today” and then I lost it all. 
After 6 years of fighting the market I have learned this one thing and it changed me and my life forever. 
I decided to stop blaming the market, people around me, situations, FOMC, YouTube, and retreat to the silence and void.
There I found the solution to my problem and it was me all along.
I have in my life learned how to make decisions.
Simple right: No
FOLLOW ME: An effective decision is not correct all the time but is correct all the time (not a typo)
Effective decision making is based on “rules” and these rules can only be created by the trader individually (in my opinion) 
FVG, 15ORB, VWAP, etc but WHAT ARE YOUR RULES?
What’s the thing that propels you to pull the trigger and the most important question: 
Can you do it again and again and again? 
I have reached this point and it has cost me everything to get here and I desire to encourage others that felt the market of the market and believe that your decisions can change your family forever. 
Don’t fight the market: Fight yourself!

I kept all of my investments and started trading options on a small scale, say 10 or so options per trade. Usually 1 - 3 per week even though I could trade more. Generally speaking there is no more that 15% of my account value being used for this.

I've quite often taken the profit and invested it in actual shares leaving a small cash pile to make the next option trade. Meanwhile I have 5 investments that have gained over 100% making money the slow way, but putting me closer to my goal. I have a few turds, biotech mostly because I did not exit in time.

I did blow up my cash stock twice, once I waited for my regular cash deposits into my investment account to start and once I used margin to trade the ""Independence day"" tariff announcement, those puts printed.

Have I lost potential profit by not buying? Who hasn't? But I've also avoided potential losses so my total account value is up ~120% on the year (discounting the regular deposits, why am I doing math so early on a weekend?) which is good enough for me.

All that said I use Schwab and Think Or Swim. The recent mobile oriented ""brokers"" seem to have a goal of making the stock market into a mobile casino game benefiting only themselves in the end."

https://preview.redd.it/nstp8t7n3rqf1.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d28d95b2960ee9c5395425e1ff838c9d1ba80df1

I felt RFK Jr. would NOT change course so looked into how I could play this. Turns out I was right about this as Trump has just teased the announcement for today I believe?

Quick research found re: Tylenoln/Kenvue:

* Tylenol is only like 10% or so of KVUE revenue
* $KVUE dropping 10% by end of month didn't look super juicy, only about a 1:2.5 RR from puts. 

https://preview.redd.it/cim0ltky3rqf1.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=072b74aaae546a4e5de2357e3071e74d1769386b

* But I wasn't sure if it would actually drop an additional 10% since it had dropped a fair amount already. And a 5% drop would only generate a 33% gain. Not enough for me to place a bet

So then my big brain thinks, well if people stop using Tylenol then what would they turn to instead?? ADVIL RIGHT?? I do some quick research on Advil.

*  it's owned by a company caled Haleon ($HLN) - it's an optionable ticker
* ADVIL MAKES UP 60% OF $HLN SALES
* The calls have a high spread but the R:R looks gooooood.
* I feel like a genius. 
* I buy
* I do some post-purchase research to just confirm my trade/thesis was good

And this is where I realize playing $HLN calls was a mistake in case anybody else was having the same bright idea as me.

1. The report about Tylenol is linking use of Tylenol during PREGNANCY with autism in babies
2. Advil ALREADY has issues with women using it in pregnancy

Correlation is not causation.

The exceedingly weak correlation meta-analysis studies note there is a possible correlation and recommends taking the minimum dose for the shortest possible duration.

Acetaminophen has been mass-marketed for about 70 years.

Some festering, pumpkin-headed elected idiot stated they have found the cause of autism.

Not sure how that fits in with the appointed brain worm infected secretary, claiming vaccines caused autism.

Prior legal cases brought against Kenvue based on the loose correlation have been dismissed.

This was definitely my most regarded trade to date (went WAY too big and way too short-dated obviously) but to be slightly fair to myself, that ""tax hit"" was ridiculous and unexpected. The market reaction was swift and immediate as soon as the market closed, WAY before the earnings call even actually started. Indicating it the drop was pretty much entirely due to the reported $1.05 EPS despite the claims I've seen others try to make that it wasn't.

However, the way Li and Zuckerberg handled explaining Meta's increased CapEx spend as if they are newly wed couple buying a big house that ""they will grow into"" when they have kids without ever effing explaining how all this AI bs will make them money in any very convincing manner did not help things and ensured the stock would keep falling.

No tears in the casino but this scared me off from ""betting"" on Amazon today and frankly probably going to go back to avoiding playing earnings calls all together. Just a completely unnecessary risk.

comment,r/options,nmawres,t3_1oki5bp,1761876579,ExtremeAddict,44,,,"This is why I always buy calls 1 month ahead of earnings with expiry 2 months after earnings.

The IV rush itself is very profitable. Hence 1 month ahead.

If you guess the direction wrong, big tech always recovers soon enough. Hence 2 months expiry. I don’t actually wait the two months. I sell immediately on market open. I eat the loss or profit immediately. But everyone knows it will recover by then. So the calls still have a lot of value left. 

With GOOG, I kept rolling my calls up until the last minute. I made about 30% on it from earnings. But another 20% from simply rolling the calls before earnings.

Remember earnings is about private information becoming public information. You cannot truly predict it. It’s a gamble always. It’s not even the business fundamentals that’s private, but also the market’s reaction to it. 

Like this tax nonsense shit shouldn’t affect META that much. But it did, because the minute algos see the EPS, then sell everything off in a microsecond, triggering cascades of selling."

Either way, he’d have an asset of some kind in his hands, even if they were deflated shares. He could turn around and keep selling calls on those shares. Instead, he lost half of a mortgage.

At the very least it looks like ceos  that want support corporations. If they come out with ways of saving money for corporations ok that's good. 

The problem I have is the economy is straight garbage right now with millions of layoffs all the time.  No one has any real money to spend.  Small business is closing and the stock market is inflated it's self by stock corporate buy outs and mergers.   No one cares about the meta universe if you can't even afford to buy bread in the grocery store. 

We are talking about getting rid of lawyers and accountants now in this new AI universe.  I always consider these people to be the backbone of the economy.

A 2% drop doesnt get you higher in terms of Delta. I heard a trading journalist that he would sell calls over 720 on the SPY and buy puts at 4900. That would be a 10x trade.

post,r/options,1o0umjr,,1759879271,clavidk,278,104.0,OpenAI &lt;&gt; AMD deal could have been predicted. More partnerships are coming in the next 1.5months.,"Theoretically speaking AMD calls could've turned $10k to $9M:

https://preview.redd.it/sa1rs9faortf1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ec460db63fb0b0f802b7c00c5cc43e5fdaae55

  
Realistically speaking, picking the right date and magnitude was probably nigh impossible, plus slippage etc.

BUT THAT SAID. I think surmising a partnership announcement IN OCTOBER or NOVEMBER definitely had a decent probability of happening.

""Sure, captain hindsight! Now how in the world would you know that?"" 

Because Sam Altman said so. 2 weeks ago he blogged this: [https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence](https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence)

The TL;DR of that blog says:

* We need moar compute, like 121 jiggawatts
* We want to make an UHMERICUH BALD EAGLE factory that builds 1 jiggawatt of new AI infra a week
* In the next 2 months we'll drop some announcements about partners we're working with to bring this dream to life

As an options trader, if you can remove one of the variables of your prediction that's huge. In this blog, Sam dropped MAJOR CLUES that is an option trader's dream:

* TIMING: They will announce partners within the next 2 months
* NAMES/INDUSTRIES: Companies in the end to end AI infra pipeline (from chips to power to building to robotics)
* MORE CLUES: Many in the good ol' US of A

So. If OpenAI has insatiable demand, makes sense they'd go with backup gf #2 AMD.

So in terms of partner announcements, chips is checked. But there's still:

* Power
* Building
* Robotics 
* More...

Who are the likely names you got for these guys? 

I asked our good ol' artificial PhD and this is what they said plus which options would have the biggest gains if the stock went up +21%  by Dec 1:

**POWER**

Oklo - Leading US advanced nuclear company dedicated to powering next-gen data centers - 43% gain

https://preview.redd.it/a62z7x13trtf1.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb0355bf8c005b7737705ad1becd3aef70e6bb5e

GE Vernova - The spinout energy powerhouse from GE, known for supplying robust gas turbines, grid solutions, and energy infrastructure - 120% gain

  
NextEra Energy - One of the largest US renewables providers (solar, wind, and nuclear) - 483%  
This one seems potentially the most interesting:

I don't know these names super well. But NEE actually seems interesting from a risk-reward perspective. Kelly criterion suggesting might actually be worth a position even if'm not super confident:

post,r/options,1mt2zda,,1755465608,[deleted],270,170.0,You let covered calls expire if it’s too much in the money,"I came across a text that mentioned you’d typically want to let a covered call expire if you’re in a situation like the one shown in the attached image.

In my case:
	•	The premium for 5 contracts was $610
	•	The base cost per share was $179.78
	•	Strike price = $185

If I let the contracts expire, I would keep the $610 premium. My upside would be capped at:

(185 – 179.78) × 500 shares + $610 = $3,220

My question is: Is this the recommended course of action given that I’ve already missed out on the stock’s recent rise, and buying to close would result in a significant loss due to the higher contract cost?  Is it better to let the calls expire and settle for the capped upside of $3,220, or buy to close at a large loss in order to keep the stock’s full upside potential?

You get the idea.

When you sell a covered call be ready to lose the shares. You are taking RISK in that you are capping your gains in exchange for a premium.

It’s not a loss, you have a gain. Just less than if you hadn’t taken the premium."

This means you are spending a few dollars to pay off what’s left of the extrinsic value of the options for the convenience of exiting the position entirely and early.

THE DANGER OF BUYING BACK AND HOLDING: such a huge run is probably over and you are looking at a 75%-99% chance of pullback. You will most likely double your losses by buying the calls and holding.

So either hold it until expiration for max profit, roll it out (and possibly up) for credit and more time, or buy the calls and sell the stock in one “close the covered call” transaction for slightly less than max profit."

Generally, if you’re deep in the money like this and the premium is substantial, letting them expire might be the way to go. You’ll still pocket that $610, and the capped upside gives you a decent return.

But it also depends on your outlook for the stock. If you think the stock has a lot of potential for more upside beyond the strike price, it might sting to miss out if you let the calls go. Buying to close can be painful, especially if it means realizing a loss, but it also keeps that potential open. 

Ultimately, it’s a balance between that immediate cash in hand versus potential future gains. If you’re feeling optimistic about the stock's trajectory, it might be worth considering closing. But if you're okay with the capped gain, then letting them expire seems like a solid play. Good luck!"

for me, what you're describing is a judgement call. if i can close the position and then sell the underlying to make more than $X i will absolutely do it and have no shame. if i can use the capital for a more profitable campaign/underlying (i'm always looking) it will tip my hand even when the gain on an early close wouldn't be ""amazing"" but i think i can make more on something else.

the only time i settle for an ITM expiry is when my premium was so good i couldn't make more profit buying out. as a PDT this kind-of sucks because now my capital is locked up until an expiry date (and contracts don't *always* assign.)

comment,r/options,n9a5wkx,t3_1mt2zda,1755483371,Helpful_Ad_8662,1,,,"I had 100 shares of BBAI with an average cost of 5.14. When the huge dunk came I sold a CC at $5 for .35 just Incase it dropped more. Instead it rocketed back up past $6. I let the CC expire with a gain of +$21. Yeah I ‘lost’ +$60 in fake value, but I view CC as free ‘income’ or a guaranteed sell for a profit. If your CC strike is above your average cost, I would let it expire. You took a bet that the stock would not rocket and you lost, but a ‘loss’ on a CC is a fake loss. It’s missed value, not a loss."
comment,r/options,n9abs5e,t3_1mt2zda,1755485718,KaleidoscopeUpper858,1,,,If the shares get called away they could gap down. Then you could buy them back cheaper plus you keep the original premium.
comment,r/options,n9acxcb,t3_1mt2zda,1755486194,DSCN__034,1,,,You can sell the shares and buy back the call as a package now if you want to free up some trading capital.  You will realize a gain. That's the nature of a winning covered call trade.
comment,r/options,n9advcp,t3_1mt2zda,1755486592,TinaMatteo,1,,,I just had this happen with AAPL’s recent rise. I was over $20 deep in the money and bot back at a major loss on Wed. I immediately sold 2dte cc near the money and recouped some of the loss. Now I still have all my shares to sell more cc for premium and unreal pnl more than double my initial buy back loss from wed. I will sell ntm again tmo for max premium.

In my Roth I seek to generate a specific dollar rate of return solely from the premium generated by the sale of the covered call. Sometimes I close the position early depending on the action of the underlying security (usually when I attain 90% of what RoR I wanted to achieve and did so quickly). But I am always indifferent if the shares are called away for the sole reason that I achieved my investment goal and got a bonus due to selling at a higher price point. For me it is all about trying to be disciplined to merely find those opportunities where I can achieve my rate of return. Are there positions that I need to nurse from time to time, yes, but I try to identify quality and am content to generate the premiums and gains. Same goes for CSP as well, naturally."

Go further out in time providing more days to exp. and use a higher strike to raise your cap on the upside. Ideally, the new premium offset should minimize the net outlay or even provide a net credit, depending on the options chain conditions.  Rolling preserves your equity position, keeps the cover, and puts you in a position to capture more upside of the stock continues higher while still collecting premium.  If this roll realizes a net loss when closing the old ITM call, it can be used for tax efficiency by offsetting other realized gains.  Depending on you overall tax situation which should always be a consideration if you trade stocks and options, this might be a good fit especially if you have gains you want to tax loss harvest against."

I’ve had positions that this has worked well on. I’ve also not been able to do it when things took off too much. I generally do it on stock I’m waiting for dividends on. I’ll roll it way out on things I know have seasons or big swings back and forth like energy or tobacco."

comment,r/options,n9ys1wi,t3_1mt2zda,1755811372,EventSevere2034,1,,,If you are happy with the profit gained from being called away then let it get called away. Sometimes you don't ever want to be called away because of tax reasons (your cost basis was very low and you would have to pay substantial capital gains after getting called away) in which case you probably want to roll your position (sell at a different strike/expiration and use that premium to buy back). You might still have a loss when you roll but it would be smaller than if you just bought back.

post,r/options,1ohwoj5,,1761614825,Wisertrader,246,78.0,2025 Account Update: Up 27% YTD Selling Futures Options as a Professional Money Manager(My Strategy),"Hi my name is Eli and I manage $8.7M in family capital, I primarily sell strangles/puts on futures, and I want to share my approach and strategy as so far this year was particularly hard for options sellers.



Many might not agree with my “chicken” like approach but it works for me, I haven’t had any losses this year and the investors are happier than ever, here are my stats(I will attach a detailed broker statement and risk measures statement from my own account below):

* YTD Return: **27.64%**
* Total Trades: **12/12 wins**
* Avg Trade Duration: 14.8 days
* Avg Position Size: 5.6% premium collected of capital
* Avg Margin requirements per position: 22% of capital
* Avg Stop Loss: 50% of credit
* YTD Sharpe: **2.47**
* Months with no activity: 2 (April &amp; October)



Before I continue I want it to be clear:

**I DO NOT SELL COURSES OR DISCORD MEMBERSHIPS**, if someone contacts you with my name selling you a course, it is a scam. (Unfortunately it happened multiple times before)



Now let’s continue!

If you have any questions regarding my statistics please let me know in the comments.



**My whole approach revolves around getting into positions where the odds are too obviously in my favour and exiting if there are critical news OR not entering if there are known upcoming major news.**

Here are examples of me being a “chicken” this year:

* I closed all positions ahead of Feb 1st, which is when Trump announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect. (After the tariffs were postponed by 30 days on Feb 3rd I think, I opened positions)
* I closed all positions ahead of Mar 1st, which is when Trump announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect again.
* Through April 2nd craziness I did not have any positions opened, and only opened positions on April 14th when tariffs were paused for 90 days.
* I haven’t traded HG (copper futures) because there still is an ongoing trade tensions between US/China (China is the biggest copper consumer in the world) and I don’t fully know what to expect.



There are more examples from this year but you get the point, I avoid uncertainty!  
Now here is my trade selection process: 

* STEP 1: I check CVOL to find relatively high volatility (CVOL: commodity volatility index), I check to see relatively high 3 month volatility specifically. 
* STEP 2: I analyze the chart: is it  an up trend/ down trend or side trend? It has to be obvious.
* STEP 3: I analyze the fundamentals of the product: 

Is there a fundamental reason for price to go up?

Is there a fundamental reason for price to go down?

Are the news that caused a CVOL increase, critical or none critical?

YES, NO, YES = Selling short puts

YES, NO, NO = Selling short puts

NO, NO, NO = Short strangle or Short puts

Every other combination is a lower probability set up.

* STEP 4: I look for a good position: Short strangle or short puts



I repeat these steps every day when looking for a position and repeat step 3 every day while in a trade to determine if fundamentals changed, which dictates my decision making.



I only trade GC/SI/HG/CL/NG/ZW/ZS, and there are more things I look at like seasonality for ZW/ZS/NG, but overall because I trade ONLY these products (for 10 years now) I got to know them very well and what can potentially influence them.

  
**Critical and none critical news are a big thing, let me give you real examples for what is considered critical and none critical:**

Critical news: Major coper mine collapse or closure, major conflict begins like Russia/Ukraine, Tariffs.

None critical news: Trump posts on social media that China should buy more soybeans, a report coming out indicating goo export sales for the previous year and more hype like announcements. 



**Just by letting fundamentals dictate your decision making, most downfalls can be avoided! Of course position size also matters and position management but letting fundamentals dictate your decisions far outweighs everything else!**  


It all sounds simple but its not easy to execute, human nature is to try and always have positions open for the hopes of making money, many traders I know had a lot of short puts on the S&amp;P ahead of April 2nd tariff announcement and they decided to keep them open which is where it turned into pure gambling in my opinion.



Yes I miss a lot of profitable trades using my approach, but I am in a business of making great decisions and the by product is profit! 

Like Warren Buffett said: we are in an opportunistic business.  
Fortune favours the patient when it comes to trading in my opinion.



**Here are the mechanics of my strategy:** 

* I sell strangles or puts only
* 45 -120 DTE: sometimes I can’t collect enough credit with 45 DTE or the strike price is too close to my liking, ideally I try to stay closest to 45 dte for best theta decay.
* I take profits at 25-50% of credit (Ideally 50%)
* My stop loss is at 50% of credit (I can allow such a tight stop loss because of my trade selection! I had 3 losses in 3 years in total, no loss reached 50% as I exited earlier because of news)
* I never roll: it can be useful but not something that is a net positive for myself
* I aim to collect 6-8% of total account capital in premium (more often than not it is less due to margin requirements)
* I make sure no single position is taking more than 30% of account capital in margin requirements.
* I never ever trade correlated products.



I am fortunate enough to have experience and had some good early guidance by a guy who was running a $130M hedge fund and was exclusively selling options, ultimately this game is all about decision making and putting greed aside, hopefully this post was useful and helped you improve your trading.  
  
  
Here are a full breakdown of all my positions this year(not including T-Bills purchases):

https://preview.redd.it/lm52j3kt5rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abdd4644cc982f493f5fd362d5152f8403b866f0

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** CVOL was great and range to stop losses was really good on the 103 DTE cycle, Opened skewed strangle to achieve the desired range to the stop losses. CVOL was up because of the WASDE report: Exports and sales were much lower than expected, however no fundamental supply/demand issues. No major reports until Feb 10th.  
  
**Reason for early exit:** The trade profited much quicker than expected and Trump might impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico which will influence the price of ZL as Canada exports it as well.





https://preview.redd.it/jpxt90016rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c451b20469c6945a8938081dd576c5f835ff8b4

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** CVOL is high relatively to the previous 6 months because there are supply concerns due to the weather in Argentina &amp; Brazil, and other small factors, overall no fundamental issues with the supply or the demand. Range to stops is also very good.

**Reason for early exit:** Trump might impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico which will influence the price of ZW as Canada exports it as well, better be safe than sorry in this case.

  


https://preview.redd.it/e4hgvxx76rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8619f829c2b675d78fac1f5787a0b2b50b560e44

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** CVOL is relatively flat, however the range to the stop losses is extremely big and Canada/US came to an agreement so the tariffs are paused for now.

**Reason for early exit:** Trump postponed the tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April but then moved them back to March 3rd! As a result the US dollar rose and the positions took a hit. At this point I am not sure what is happening but there is a possibility where some commodities develop a strong trend downward or upward as a result of the tariffs. I exited the positions the previous month due to the same reason, better be safe than sorry with unpredictable geopolitical events.

  


https://preview.redd.it/udypll5h6rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66961adc56fbe7f59f32459fa5698639f1d0af2f

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** CVOL is relatively high and the range to the stop losses is pretty good! No upcoming events that can disturb the supply/demand of silver.

**Reason for early exit:** Trump postponed the tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April but then moved them back to March 3rd! As a result the US dollar rose and the positions took a hit. At this point I am not sure what is happening but there is a possibility where some commodities develop a strong trend downward or upward as a result of the tariffs. I exited the positions the previous month due to the same reason, better be safe than sorry with unpredictable geopolitical events. Mexico is the single biggest producer and exporter of silver in the world, the tariffs might have a massive impact on the price of silver.

  


https://preview.redd.it/mejo47sl6rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ce54f8adf5798c4cc0601ff65be9107db8fa7af

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** CVOL is relatively high and the range to the stop losses is amazing! No upcoming events that can disturb the supply/demand and no major news on the WASDE report.

**Reason for early exit:** Trump postponed the tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April but then moved them back to March 3rd! As a result the US dollar rose and the positions took a hit. At this point I am not sure what is happening but there is a possibility where some commodities develop a strong trend downward or upward as a result of the tariffs. Wheat has the least chance of being affected by the tariffs as the US is mostly self sufficient and grows most of its wheat, however due to the tariffs companies plan to plant more crop this season because of the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican wheat and this can create a situation where there is much more supply and drive the price of wheat down. All in all its always better to be safe than sorry with the market and I stand by it!

  


https://preview.redd.it/4rpwvg6r6rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38904523394180fa8e6d760c72026e7de22bbd8c

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** This is a low delta high DTE trade, not the typical strangle: Tariffs were paused for 90 days so no tariffs on Mexico for now which is the single biggest producer and exporter of silver in the world. Volatility is expected to drop, the price of silver has been moving within this strike range for over 4 years. There is no stop loss on this trade initially to give the position some freedom to profit, at 30% profit the stop loss will be set at breakeven. If any major events will suddenly happen, the position will be exited manually, the position size is extremely small for that purpose of protection in case something extreme and unexpected happens.

**Reason for early exit:** Almost reached profit target within 3 days and a long weekend is coming up, no point in holding through the weekend for extra 5% profit.

  


https://preview.redd.it/yd1iefsu6rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=991a8d694b29cada0806e0606f52fd2a98878398

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** This is a low delta high DTE trade, not the typical strangle: Winter is almost over so volatility is expected to drop on NG which is perfect for us. The strikes were chosen that wide because the price of NG has been within this range of strikes since 2014 (For that contract expiration). There is no stop loss on this trade initially to give the position some freedom to profit, at 30% profit the stop loss will be set at breakeven. If any major events will suddenly happen, the position will be exited manually, the position size is extremely small for that purpose of protection in case something extreme and unexpected happens. Expected time in position: less than 30 days

**REASON FOR EARLY EXIT:** Volatile has been increasing for the past 3 days and there is a storage report coming out tomorrow. The price becomes extremely directional as well which is not a good sign. Overall this position is not progressing like it should due to volatility increasing slowly, which is never a good thing! The delta on the position was 0 which is ideal! But still no additional profit for the position for 3 days and even some small losses from the profits. Better be safe than sorry especially because of the EIA storage report coming up tomorrow.

  


https://preview.redd.it/y86rkqf17rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ac87395cd90dd88372affcbe2a6751b3234d2fe

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** This is a low delta high DTE trade like the previous one last month, today (Thur May 1st) the storage report was released and everything looks great, volatility is expected to keep falling as temperatures rise. I chose to sell lower deltas than usual because the price of NG is still not in a clear range so position was also kept smaller and profit target is at 30% to make sure we are out of the trade quickly for this month! Why? because even though May is getting warmer, some years there are a few very cold days in May that can cause temporary volatility and I prefer to avoid that! This year everything looks great until the end of May but better safe than sorry. The strikes were selected because NG has been trading in this range for 10 years, like the previous trade. Expected time in position: less than 20 days

**REASON FOR EXIT:** Profit target hit.



https://preview.redd.it/hypm5m367rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5f5ec8961281c018c9f58b24f0e83e17d6de1e9

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** Temperatures in June are predicted to not be as hot as expected initially which is a good thing for the position! Overall Natural gas has been stable and we are heading slowly into summer, NG is also not affected by the current geopolitical instability. The strikes were selected because they give a very wide range and the total delta for the position is near neutral! The DTE is much lower than the previous trade because there is much less skew towards the call side, therefore the position is much more neutral and theta is enormous for this position, 50% profit should be reached under 14 days most likely. The defence for the position: will be buying or selling the future itself if the position becomes very directional, will probably buy 1 future for every 3-4 strangles (depending on the delta) and there will be a tight stop loss for the future contract. This will lower directional risk significantly and lower margin as well.

**REASON FOR EARLY EXIT:** Too much uncertainty given the Israel-Iran conflict, NG reacted a little too much for my liking and its better to be safe than sorry in these situations.

**REASON FOR ENTRY:** Technical: Price is moving within a very nice side trend, strikes were selected to be outside that range! CVOL: In terms of volatility, it is excellent currently at the highs relatively to the previous 3 months! Fundamentals: Demand increased due to a big purchase from the US by an undisclosed buyer (probably China), so there is no future increased demand, just a big purchase. Crop condition for 70% of it is good to excellent and weather is favourable! Seasonality is also favourable with price being range bound until the end of the month. I expect to be in the position for about 10 days, it will be closed before Aug 1st regardless as there is no way of knowing how tariffs might affect the price!

**REASON FOR EXIT:** Profit target was hit

  


https://preview.redd.it/p40pmlng7rxf1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5178e48bf1688175b5c94981e510c18e8983c94

**REASON FOR ENTRY:**

* Technical: Price is still moving within a very nice side trend, strikes were selected to be outside that range and to collect enough credit.,
* CVOL: Volatility went up in the past two days and is perfect.,
* Fundamentals: Price went up sharply due to trump's post saying that China should be buying more soybean and the monthly WASDE report where the yields are amazing but the some of the other numbers came a little lower than expected, overall no major supply/demand imbalances.,
* Seasonality: Looks favourable at the moment.,
* Defence: I will most likely be rolling the entire position or the tested side only if the position reaches a loss of -50% of credit, the exact defence depends on the news driving the price.,

I expect to be in the position for around 20 days, if CVOL falls then it will be significantly less.

**REASON FOR EARLY EXIT:** The end of the month is nearing and the position is profiting much slower than expected, as a rule of thumb volatility usually rises at the beginning of a month and goes down at the end if it so the risk of carrying the position over into September is not worth it.

**REASON FOR ENTRY:**

* Technical: Price is moving within a big side trend, last time price was at the $52 level is in 2021.,
* CVOL: Volatility is somewhat low but overall moving sideways.,
* Fundamentals: Lots of uncertainty that can drive the price of CL upwards, Ukraine keeps attacking Russian oil infrastructure, Iran/Israel conflict might reignite, rate cuts will support higher oil prices as the dollar will fall! Many reasons for price to potentially go up and limited reasons for it to go down as of now.,
* Seasonality: Price should increase in the coming days and stabilize.,
* Defence: I will most likely be rolling the entire position if it reaches a loss of -100% of credit, the exact defence depends on the news driving the price down that hard.,

comment,r/options,nls64u7,t3_1ohwoj5,1761630433,YerbaEnthusiast,24,,,"Interesting stuff. I’m curious how you perform in choppier market conditions? 

I ask because it seems this risk adverse approach  underperforms in a strong bull market like we’ve been in. For example, I buy LEAPS or run simple wheel and I am up 71% YTD or 178% since 2024. 

Don’t mean to put you down, because your 27% is more impressive given the size of the portfolio, but maybe you really shine in a 2022 kind of market which the data provided doesn’t highlight?"
comment,r/options,nlt4c2i,t3_1ohwoj5,1761649815,777gg777,14,,,"1. Options market makers adjust IV for “is there news coming”. Why would you assume they are making in efficient prices for upcoming news? 
2. You have only done 12 trades and are selling OTM options. Is it that surprising you have not gotten blown out yet?  Remember the delta is also an approximation  of the  % chance it ends in the money. 
3. The exact risk of selling naked options is that it like going all in on a poker games. It works every time until it doesn’t. That time it doesn’t the losses are outsized. 
4. Options do not have linear risk and for that reason using sharpe ratio doesn’t really make much sense.




In other words, if someone made money selling hurricanes insurance to 12 people in the same state and made it through a season without losses would they know they sold the policies for the right price based on that amount of data? 

You would be well advised to be extremely disciplined in the amount of capital you risk on a strategy like this."

I recommend every option seller to do this, especially if you’re selling FOPs because that premium will not be swept into your securities account (IBKR, Schwab…) which means that cash will not collect interest. So buy T-bills, or park it all in SGOV or something similar (SGOV has the best margin requirements of 7% in a portfolio margin account, other than T-bills which are 1%).

What I like about SGOV is that it’s more liquid and cheaper to transact into and out of over T-bills, typically… at least if you need to get a small amount of cash out for something."

I'm particularly curious about your position sizing methodology. When you say 5.6% premium collected of capital, are you referring to notional premium or do you calculate it differently for futures? I've been experimenting with similar approaches on /ES and /NQ but I've struggled with the capital efficiency aspect since futures margins can be so variable.

Your 50% stop loss discipline is something I really respect. I've gotten burned a few times this year holding positions too long hoping for theta decay to save me. That April and October pause is interesting too - I'm guessing you stepped aside during some of the choppier periods? I've been trying to develop better market regime filters myself.

One thing I'd love to hear more about is how you handle overnight gamma risk, especially on the short puts. I've noticed futures can gap pretty aggressively and I'm always paranoid about getting blown out on a Sunday night open."
post,r/options,1nhxmrw,,1757969134,breakyourteethnow,245,49.0,Simple Repeatable Strategies to Make it Big,"I've wrote for this sub for couple years now, many posts being the top post of the month. Am back to share more knowledge this time covering simple repeatable strategies which work exceptionally well for me.

Let me preface by saying there's only three ways to make it really big in the market either holding shares long term, striking it big on market's next big drama last week was Google verdict, or utilizing leverage which is what will cover here.

1, **Diagonal 65 delta / 35 delta** \- This structure should be a beginner's go-to, it's a slightly ITM call at 65 delta with a month's worth of time, selling against the position OTM weekly at 35 delta. This creates a diagonal, highly resilient, cost effective, plenty of time, building good intrinsic value.

If you're an expert at making calls, opening spreads will cost you more money or gains than the losses they would've otherwise help offset. These days I only trade monthly calls, no spreads and am about 30 delta. This is not for beginners. Here's how I trade

2. **Monthly Calls 5% OTM on Mags 7** \- Chart only uses 2 indicators EMA's 20/50/100/200 and stoch RSI. When one of the Mags 7 dips to 100 EMA or even better 200 EMA, if the 4 hour stoch RSI is under 20 and beginning to curl upwards, and candlesticks have bottom wicks showing buyers stepping-in then I'll buy 5% OTM monthly calls. I recently traded NVDA from $170 to $177, APPL $230 to $234, and AMZN $228 to $232 which closed today. Many are 1-5 day holds, selling for 40-80% gain. Trading 4hour almost exclusively.

Am over 80% port in SGOV or cash collecting interest, have very little faith in the current geopolitical environment and believe we'll see flash crashes every 6-12 months. So while I trade monthly calls, the bulk of port is cash awaiting real opportunity in the market to take huge bets when probabilities are most favorable.

3. **LEAPS after VIX spike + FGI Dump** \- The bread and butter, such an easy trading style but the absolute most effective simply buying when fear has peaked in the market. When the Fear and Greed index dumps to 25 or below, and VIX explodes $35+ even better in $40-$50 territory, only then buy LEAPS on the best performing earnings reports of recent. So when FGI dumps next, VIX spikes, then I'll go buy LEAPS on a company like RDDT or Reddit which recently crushed its earnings report.

Trading doesn't need to be overly complicated, it's more about being patient, recognizing your set-ups and having the firsthand experience overtime to know when to jump out. I'm simply using stoch RSI + EMA's to trade the most liquid companies aka Mags 7, waiting for prices to dip and then buying a monthly which sometimes even lead into ER benefiting from IV expansion as well as price appreciation. - This is just to stay occupied trading monthlies and DCA'ing ETFs in retirement, while awaiting big dumps in market to really load up with LEAPS. Three pronged approach trade Mags monthlies, DCA ETFs for retirement, and stay bulk of port cash to await true opportunities in the market when fear peaks."

Happy trading."
comment,r/options,neevti0,t3_1nhxmrw,1757969733,Ok_Butterfly2410,10,,,So you’re buying the leaps when vix is high or when its recently high and crashed?
comment,r/options,neh7cq4,t3_1nhxmrw,1758001051,sharpetwo,10,,,"There is some good logic in what you laid out, but like most “repeatable” systems, the context matters more than the recipe.

The diagonal (65/35) is fine as long as realized vol stays in line. Where people get hurt is when the short weekly bleeds into a trend; momentum accelerates, the short leg explodes, and you are rolling at a loss. It works in chop, it struggles in persistent trends.

The Mag 7 dip calls: also fair, but those 40–80% pops only tell half the story. Sometimes the EMA + stoch combo lines up and you still get chopped for weeks. The decay is real if you are early. You need discipline on stops and sizing, otherwise the small losers eat the big winners you showcase.

The leaps after VIX spikes is the cleanest of your three. That is a genuine edge: convexity after forced deleveraging has paid for decades. The problem is not the entry, it is the patience: sitting in cash until fear peaks is harder than it sounds. Most burn capital in between.

So all three have merit. They also all fail outside of the regimes they were designed for. The real trick is not just having the setups, but knowing when not to use them. That is the difference between a good diary of trades and something that scales.

Good luck."

Running SPY Put Protection (Finnhub + Yahoo version)... 2025-10-08 10:43:47 | SPY $669.12 | VIX Rank 0.07

# ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s

It looks like the SPY price of $669.12 might be off, especially considering it should be closer to $510-570 in 2025. I think Finnhub might be returning an unexpected value, maybe due to currency scaling or missing exchange info. It might help to double-check the price from Yahoo or use a different endpoint to resolve this. Let's add sanity checks to confirm the price is accurate.

To make the SPY price more reliable, we’ll get it from Yahoo using yfinance. We’ll modify the `get_spy_price` function to check the price from Finnhub first. If it's missing or too far off from Yahoo's last price, it will fallback to Yahoo. We'll implement a sanity check to avoid discrepancies and keep things simple.

Done

Your feed’s printing, but SPY at **$669** is nonsense. That’s a flaky Finnhub quote. Easiest fix: pull **SPY price from Yahoo** (rock solid) and use Finnhub **only** for the options chain.

I did see some correlated things I watch go pretty bearish to end the day: $HYG and % of stocks above VWAP were definitely hinting at a move lower to end the day was likely, but, maybe the dealer positioning hinted otherwise.

Dealers were short gamma below 6750 and long it above. We kind of settled at the point to cause maximum pissyness from those who were playing long single options plays 🤣 As market makers are prone to doing...

post,r/options,1o6j1yt,,1760456650,RivetHeadRK,233,36.0,The one rule that stopped me from blowing up my account,"So I've been trading options on and off for a year, and honestly I was doing pretty terrible until I read through some trader's breakdown of their strategy framework. The key insight was something super simple: I was completely focused on finding winners instead of managing risk first. It sounds obvious when you say it out loud, but I literally didn't know what my maximum loss was on most of my trades. I was just guessing.

The shift changed everything for me. Before I enter any position now, I know exactly how much I can lose. I'm using like a 2% risk per trade maximum, which means on a 10k account I'm not risking more than 200 bucks per trade. I started with basic strategies like long calls and long puts to learn the mechanics, then added cash secured puts and covered calls into my rotation. Yeah that sounds small but it's enough to actually profit once you nail the basics. I've been doing better in the last month than my entire first year combined, and I'm way less stressed because I'm not gambling.

I think a lot of people skip this part because it's not sexy, but honestly managing risk first and then thinking about profits second completely reframed how I approach options. Has anyone else had this kind of shift in their strategy?"

You also get more positions open to be fully in the market, which helps diversify the account.

I don’t use much TA, I mostly just watch for breakouts and try to catch the move after. Linked a pic of my spreadsheet so you can see what I’ve been doing.

Honestly, I think I’m posting because it’s felt too good to be true. I’ve been making some extra cash, but it feels dangerous every single day. Usually I’m solid at managing losses, but today (and one other time in the past couple months) I just threw my plan out the window and ate two $900+ hits.

I’m sticking with the strategy and trying to refine it, but every time I look online, spreads seem to have this negative stigma around them. For those who’ve traded spreads long term, should I just expect to eat a few of these big losses each year, or is there really a way to graduate from them?

comment,r/options,nhfkmpk,t3_1nwcn29,1759438535,TotalDistribution561,27,,,"TastyTrade has a few videos about 0DTE. In a nutshell, they recommend:  
\- SPX: you get the 60/40 tax advantage (60% LTCG)  
\- Sell iron condors, $20 wide wings, &lt; 15 delta. I'm paranoid, so I do &lt; .11 delta, for $200-$300 credit.  
\- Open after 10am ET, watch the 15min when momentum slows down (ex. VWAP test)  
\- Take profit at 20% (ex. $40 if credit was $200), or by noon the latest (the 20% only applies to 0DTEs, longer exp could be 25%-50%). Do not hold til expiration, otherwise gamma will turn a winner into a loser. Winners usually hit the 20% in \~30mins. If it didn't resolve yet, consider scaling down, or watching closely for a potential exit on a TICK extreme (one of the market internals) even if TP% was not reached.  
\- Stop loss at 40%-60% of credit received (ex. -$80 if credit was $200). Even though you have $2k-credit on the line, you're risking much much less per trade. $2k would be the worst case scenario if you hold til exp (not recommended).

Greeks to consider:  
\- Gamma: the rate of P/L whiplash. Exponentially more volatile every hour after lunch time.  
\- Vega: how much $ you win/lose if IV increases/decreases  
\- Theta: how much $ you win/lose when time passes  
\- Delta: aim for neutral net delta (-5 to +5, but aim for 0 delta). Neutral in the SPX means SPX price can move up/down and your P/L won't suffer as much as if net delta was, say -20 (more bearish), or the opposite.

Stock picking is the clue and knowledge about the incident that caused the drop. Bad earnings or worsening conditions e.g. in the car industry - stay away. Disaster on mining stocks, or rapid changing sentiment on ever-bullish stocks like NVDA or TSLA ... go for it.

I think the fact that every single one of these threads has people expressing their utter disbelief that someone would engage in teaching if they didn’t have to is actually a reflection of the extent to which Americans do not value and respect teacher and coaches. 
Crazy idea, what if teaching, helping others grow  and avoid the same mistakes they’ve made in the past, actually gives satisfaction and purpose to some wealthy people with too much time on their hands. What if running a discord brings them joy while having an income source that requires they spend a lot of time at home alone?  

I’m not saying all these services are worth it. For one, being a good trader does not make you a good teacher. Most of them have no pedagogical background or experience in curriculum development. They are also not regulated and do not take any accountability for the impact their teaching has on their students. If a medical school only produced failing doctors then they would be shutdown. That is not the case for trading programs taught by unlicensed traders. 

But I really do not buy the premise that teaching trading is inherently a scam, or that no one is doing it with the intention of helping their students/community be successful. Being excited to teach something that you’re passionate about is a common and beautiful thing. 

If you’re looking into a program, research before you buy. Don’t be enticed by limited time coupons. Look for their credentials, their transparency, their level of accountability for educational outcomes, reviews on trust pilot, and experiences of prior students. 

In 2025 you can even learn chemical engineering and astrophysics on your own, for free, on YouTube. This doesn’t change that people benefit from a structured learning environment, supportive community, and experienced teachers/mentorship. Just make sure that’s what you’re paying for, not some crappy PDFs and a useless chat room."

post,r/options,1otcbvt,,1762777354,OptionsJive,207,32.0,Trade Like a Hedge Fund: Copy My Simple Weekly Process,"I often share my trade ideas here, but from your feedback and comments, I realized that just seeing the trades isn't enough. What most of you actually want is **strong clarity** to understand **why** I take certain setups and **how** you can build that same process for your own account.

So today, I want to do something different. As someone who manages an options hedge fund focused on shorting volatility, I'll walk you through a simplified version of the same process I use every week, but adapted for smaller, individual portfolios.

This is my actual Monday routine, condensed into something you can replicate in about an hour. It's about clarity, not any kind of prediction.

# Step 1: Macro and Volatility Regime Check

Before I look at any tickers, I start with one question: what volatility environment are we in? So, I check:

* VIX term structure (contango / backwardation).
* VVIX, VIX9D / VIX3M ratio (shows if traders are paying up for short-term protection).
* Volatility Risk Premium (the gap between implied and realized volatility).

If you run a smaller account, don't overcomplicate it. Just look at **VIX and its curve**. That alone tells you a lot. That one observation often defines how to trade options for the entire week.

# Step 2: RRG Sector Rotation Scan

Next, I use **Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG)** and **ETF flow data** to spot where institutional money is rotating relative to SPY or QQQ. I focus on sectors in the Improving and Leading quadrants. This gives me a short list of sectors worth watching:

https://preview.redd.it/4fyoa4q6af0g1.png?width=2194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=326beed4067134b091eaa9a5443006ef740a661e

For this week (**November 10th, 2025**), I'm focusing on: **Materials (XLB), Energy (XLE), Financials (XLF), Industrials (XLI), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV)**.

They're moving from Improving to Leading, or Lagging to Improving.

# Step 3: Volatility Surface Check

Once I've got my sectors, I study how options volatility behaves inside them. That's where most of the edge comes from. I check:

* IV Rank to see if volatility is rich or cheap relative to its 52-week range.
* Implied Vol (IV) vs Realized Vol (RV) to see if the market's overpricing movement.
* Skew; which side of the options chain carries the fear premium (puts vs calls).
* And I map IV vs IV Rank plotting implied volatility on one axis and IV Rank on the other:

https://preview.redd.it/65e6t5nr4f0g1.png?width=2004&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b6229325ae89901d63406445b5d4aa812dcfbe

This visual helps me quickly spot where volatility is high but not extreme (great for short-vol setups) or low but rising (ideal for long-vol entries).

If you trade a smaller account, you don't need complex modeling. You just check where each ticker sits on that IV vs IV Rank map and ask: ""Is volatility overpriced or underpriced this week?""

That simple visual filter helps you instantly see where the best asymmetries lie. So, this week I'll focus on **XLB, XLP, XLE, and XLV** for premium-selling strategies, and XLRE for volatility buying setups. All other sectors I'll be skipping this week.

# Step 4: Build Core Trades

Now I translate all that analysis into actual positions, but I only trade the most liquid, fundamentally strong names.

Each sector from the RRG scan has its own watchlist of pre-analyzed tickers that pass two filters:

* options liquidity (tight spreads, deep open interest).
* strong fundamentals (I only trade the top 1% of companies).

From those, I select setups that best fit the current volatility regime. If I don't see a clear opportunity in any individual ticker within a sector, I'll trade the sector ETF instead.

For example, this week in Materials I don't see attractive single-name setups, so my focus is on XLB as the sector proxy.

All positions are typically 30-45 DTE, where theta decay works efficiently but adjustments remain flexible. And I make sure not to double up on correlated exposures."
post,r/options,1mzmuic,,1756117818,BlitzDaTweetGawd,189,137.0,"Options Are Better Than Futures. There, I Said It.","I already know the futures crowd is gonna flood the comments with “cope” and “skill issue” replies, but I don’t care. I’ve traded both. I respect both. But I’m going to say something most people won’t:

If you’re a retail trader with a job, less than six figures in your account, and limited screen time, options are just the better tool.  sorry :)

Not because they’re easier. Not because they’re safer. But because they give you more control and more flexibility in the real world. Especially if you're trying to grow your account without blowing it up.

People love to say futures give you better risk control because it’s pure price action, and you can use tight stops. That’s the theory. But what really happens?

You enter, price gets close to your stop, and instead of taking the L, you widen it. Or worse you cancel it. You tell yourself it’s just a flush or itll bounce. You’re not managing risk. You’re gambling with more exposure. And when your stop *does* get hit? lol. in futures, you don’t always get filled cleanly, especially during high-volatility moves or low-liquidity sessions.

Futures don’t make you disciplined. They just punish your lack of discipline *faster* and *harder*. That’s not risk management that’s Russian roulette with margin.

With options? Your risk is defined. You know what you're willing to lose before you click the button. No partial fills. No freak candle spikes taking you out. If your thesis fails, you take the hit on your terms.

Now let’s talk about decay. “But options decay! You’re fighting theta...yada yada yada”

Yeah, and? That’s a feature if you know what you’re doing.

I trade SPY options intraday. I use delta to ride direction. I use gamma for timing turns. I sell into overpriced IV. I fade with premium. Theta isn’t something I fear. I don’t blindly swing YOLO calls. I structure trades around probability, not just price levels. And guess what? That’s something futures simply don’t offer. There’s no multidimensional edge. It’s linear. Direction or nothing. Options give me leverage on time, volatility, and priceall in one trade.

Most retail traders dont have the time or emotional stamina to babysit a DOM window for six hours. They’ve got jobs, families, responsibilities. options let you participate in the market on your terms. You want to build a slow grind position over a week? You can do that. You want to scalp a supply rejection at 10am and be done by lunch? You can do that too. You can define your risk, play with time, and choose the structure that works for your style.

Futures don’t offer that. You’re in or you’re out. Now or never. Full exposure the moment you click.

And let’s not ignore how brutal position sizing in futures can be. a 10 point move against you and you are in the red on your entire position size.  If you’re sizing appropriately in options, you can risk $50 or $100 on a trade and still get meaningful exposure and have time to ride out the trade even in the face of time decay. Try doing that on ES. You either go tiny with no edge, or you go big and pray.

I’m not saying futures are useless i am obviously biased. They’re amazing tools for the right trader. The problem is the loudest voices saying “futures &gt; options” are usually full-time traders with huge accounts, ten monitors, and zero context for what most retail traders actually deal with.

If you’re a full-time scalper, glued to the tape all day, and you’re good at what you do? More power to you. But if you’re trying to grow a $5K to $25K account while working a job on the side, options give you more edge, more flexibility, and more survivability. And that’s what most people need early on

So why don’t more people talk about this? Because options take more work. You have to learn Greeks. You have to think in probabilities. You have to manage contracts, not just candles. But that’s also why most people fail with them because they don’t want to do the work. And that’s fine. But if you *do* take the time to learn, there is no instrument more versatile or powerful imo.

comment,r/options,nakcf6g,t3_1mzmuic,1756120547,zapembarcodes,26,,,"This is a moronic take.

First of all, futures have options too. You can trade options on futures, same exact mechanics. I sell puts on S&amp;P futures. It's become one of my primary income trades. I don't have to watch it at all. That's because I buy a hedge with every contract I sell. The only active management I do is roll my monthly hedge, once a month, if the position has turned against me and I need burn more theta to make a profit. Often times I'm in my target profit by the end of the month.

On sizing, you can trade micro futures, which are 1/10th the size. If you can't afford to trade a single micro contract, you probably shouldn't be trading futures... But sure, span margin is a thing to keep in mind. That's why I like to simulate black swan events (like COVID or Volmageddon levels) and crank up IV on a P&amp;L diagram before I enter any futures trade, and make sure I can pony up the cash in such an event. If I can't, I downsize. Anyway, this is why futures are not for beginners. You need to be aware of how futures sweeps work.

That being said, futures trading is not limited to scalping. But yes, it is one of the best tools to scalp. Which reminds me, trading SPY options intra day isn't exactly pragmatic for somebody working a job, with responsibilities, families. Unless you know what you're doing. I trade 0DTE too (on SPX only) and I'll sell vertical spreads with a stop loss and limit price; I set it and forget. No need to stare at the screens at all. I'm comfortable with the loss at the stop loss level. But this is just proper risk management, something that can (and should) be practiced with any vehicle of trading you use."

That said, I think you’re underselling futures a bit. The appeal isn’t just “price action + stops” it’s the simplicity and liquidity. No Greeks, no expiration headaches, no IV crush. Just pure directional trading with insane liquidity, tight spreads, and no worrying about decaying premium. For people who *are* disciplined and can stick to stops, that’s a huge advantage.

I’d say it comes down to lifestyle and mindset:

If you’ve got a day job, limited capital, and want asymmetric exposure, options fit better.  
If you can sit at the screens, like clean execution, and don’t want to juggle Greeks, futures can be the sharper tool.

So yeah, futures punish lack of discipline harder… but for some traders, that pain is exactly what forces them to develop discipline."

post,r/options,1mr64iv,,1755282517,Oversidious,185,59.0,GOOGL 6 month 180C Paid Out,"Bought the 180 strike price back when the price of each was 7$ a pop. Sold it today at 33$ each. 

Strategy: Think about blue chip companies with really good fundamentals, now at a massive discount vs. their usual highs, and everyone's at most at a panic. The market can definitely drop more but even if it does, how much further could your investment drop? And how high could it go if it rebounds to even half the previous high? Some trades are incredibly +EV but it takes connecting just a few dots:

(1) Current Market Trends -  A.I (biggest one) 
(2) Biggest players - GOOGL, NVDA, AMD, MSFT
(3) Relative performance - (rank companies)
(4) Fundamentals - balance sheet, debt, earnings etc.
(5) Sentiment Analysis - Monthly, weekly, daily (news, Twitter, other high impact sources with high viewership)

Combine them all into one and you usually get a great trade opening based on just the definitive fundamentals of what is perceived to be valuable. At that point, those 7$ 180C were way too cheap. The upside was easily till 210-220.

If you're someone who trades a similar way using options, in the 6-8 month range (to reduce risk and capture big movements still), let's figure out (maybe we can make a Discord) and actually get some high quality trade ideas going."

The gist of it is:  buy LEAPS as far out as you can, and very far ITM, on Tech stocks, and wait.

comment,r/options,nia8tdb,t3_1nzjg2x,1759859573,Impressive-Bee-5183,3,,,"**I run a similar setup, but I'd strongly recommend keeping** ***some*** **stock allocation. Here's why:**

**My allocation (\~$150k account):**

* 40% core stock positions (mostly broad index ETFs like SPY/QQQ)
* 40% cash for options deployment
* 20% LEAPs and other options strategies

**Why I keep stocks:**

1. **Leverage risk management** \- LEAPs give you great upside leverage, but they can go to zero. Stocks can drop 50-80% and still recover. In a prolonged bear market or correction, your LEAPs can expire worthless while stocks just sit there waiting to bounce back.
2. **Theta decay doesn't care about your thesis** \- You can be 100% right about direction but wrong about timing, and LEAPs will still bleed. Stocks don't have expiration dates.
3. **Dividend income** \- Not huge, but it's real cash flow that LEAPs don't provide. This can help fund more options plays.
4. **Psychological stability** \- When your LEAPs are down 60-70% (and it WILL happen), having a stable stock base keeps you from making emotional decisions. That core position is your anchor.
5. **Rolling costs** \- LEAPs need to be rolled eventually. Each roll costs you the bid-ask spread plus potential slippage. Over years, this adds up. Stocks you just hold.

**The case for 100% LEAPs:**

If you're in a raging bull market and have the risk tolerance, going heavier into LEAPs can absolutely outperform. But ask yourself: what happens if we get a 2022-style grind down? Or a flash crash where volatility spikes and your options get hammered on both price AND IV crush?

**My suggestion for your situation:**

Keep 20-30% in core stock positions (tax-advantaged if possible), use 50-60% for options, and keep the rest in cash/crypto. The stocks act as ballast. You'll still get plenty of leverage from your LEAPs, but you won't be 100% exposed to theta decay and binary expiration risk.

Remember: LEAPs are amazing tools, but they're still options. Having at least *some* equity that can't expire worthless is just smart risk management, especially once you're playing with six figures.

comment,r/options,ni74nlt,t3_1nzjg2x,1759813629,ShootFishBarrel,2,,,"Instead of going 100% LEAPS and trying to replicate stock ownership (which can get wrecked in a bear market), I use LEAPS for what they’re really great at: asymmetric upside with capped downside. The goal is to risk a small portion of your capital across multiple long-dated, high-volatility bets where just one or two home runs can move the needle on your entire portfolio.

Personally, I recommend:

•	Around 70% in boring stuff (cash equivalents, broad ETFs, low-risk yield)

•	Around 5 to 10% (DCA!) allocated to LEAPS on 3× ETFs like TQQQ or SOXL

•	The rest for short puts, occasional spreads, or other directional trades

The trick isn’t to go all-in. The trick is to use small amounts of aggressive leverage that simulate stock ownership but limit potential downside while expanding your upside. You want to find the sweet spot where you’re not being too cautious or too greedy.

There is a minimum investment size where this starts to make sense. Ideally, you should be laddering into and out of LEAPS over time and planning for some of your positions to expire worthless. That’s fine, because the math still works in your favor if just one or two pop off.

Key guidelines I follow:

•	Buy LEAPS just slightly out of the money to reduce theta decay and keep some convexity

•	Use expiration dates 24 to 36 months out if available. These ultra-long LEAPS (800+ days) are often a better value per dollar because they decay more slowly and give you more time to be right

•	Diversify across different strikes and entry dates. Dollar-cost averaging into LEAPS can be just as important as it is with stocks, especially when you’re using aggressive leverage

But if QQQ trends up smoothly over two or three years, TQQQ could 4× or even 8×. That same call might be worth 5 to 10× or more. You don’t need a high batting average. You just need to hit hard when it counts.

This strategy demands discipline. You need a strong cash cushion not just to weather drawdowns, but to reload confidently after losing positions. DCA and patience matter. Chasing after the next spike with your whole stack doesn’t.

Rather than ditching stocks to go “full LEAPS,” think of LEAPS as leverage with a seatbelt. They are not safe, but they define your risk upfront and let you take shots that can truly move the needle. If you size them like moonshots, not like replacements, they can be a powerful addition to your playbook."

But after jumping into a live account way too early and losing a big chunk of it without properly testing my strategy, I realized I had it backwards. I went back to paper trading, and I stuck with it for almost a full year.

That time helped me in ways I didn’t expect. I got to test setups in different market conditions, learned to wait for entries instead of forcing trades, and built confidence in sticking to a plan. It also gave me a lot more trust in my execution, since I had already seen the trades play out many times before.

If you’re just getting started, I’d seriously recommend starting with a paper account. It’s not about pretending to win. It’s about practicing, building discipline, and stress-testing your process without burning capital."

This one lesson alone is extremely valuable.  Lots of folks here on reddit are really big on 'wheeling stocks'. I have learned that doing extremely simple things like setting alerts and holding off on making buys until an indicator like the MACD signal line crosses the average line improves overall performance.  It also teaches you patience. 

I use Think or Swim and tend towards swing trading options.  ToS has a steep learning curve.  Setting things up to generate alerts to my email and mobile has helped me quite a bit.

I need some realism for my own confidence. I have been looking deep into why this strategy could possibly fail in the real market, but nowhere do I find an actual answer to this question. 

**How the Strategy works in Principle:**  
This Strategy uses SPY 0DTE Options. It is a simple Short Iron Butterfly. An ATM Call and an ATM Put is sold, while the wings are bought further OTM (more on that later). A trade is made exactly 2h and 30 min before the market closes. The reason for the late entry is to avoid the larger market movements that happen at the beginning of the trade. So TLDR: The Strategy makes Money if the SPY doesn't move much in the last 2,5 hours of the market open. Likewise, it loses money, if the SPY moves too much in the last 2,5 hours of the market open. 

**The Data Used:**  
For this Backtest, I collected 1m Timeframe Data on the whole Option Chain for the SPY 0DTE Options. Each Minute is saved in a .parquet file and it collects Entry Time, Current Price of the Underlying, Ask and Bid for each available Strike Price, Last Price, Volume, Open Interest and Implied Volatility. 

This Data is collected via Yahoo Finance. I know about the 15 min Delay, but that doesn't affect the outcome of the strategy, since it is a backtest anyway. And yes, since Yahoo Finance does not offer a 1m Timeframe for the whole option chain over such a long period of time, this meant I had to collect it every day via a bot running 24/7. So the Data is in Fact, real and fairly accurate in my Opinion. 

The Data reaches from 9. September 2025 to 17. October 2025. I know that this timeframe isn't huge for a backtest, but I don't believe that this is the reason this strategy wouldn't work in the real market. 

**About the Graphic:**  
On the Screenshot you can see the price of the Underlying (SPY) as well as the Equity Curve of the hypothetical Portfolio. The Vertical Green Lines are the Entry Points of the Trade, exactly 2,5h before the market closes. The horizontal Orange Lines are the Break Even Lines, where PnL = 0$. The Purple Dottet Horizontal Lines are the Max-Loss-Lines, so if the market closes below this line at the end of the day, the maximum Loss for this specific trade was reached. And the Red lines can be ignored tbh, because they simply indicate where you would loose exactly the sum that you could have made as a profit on that day. 

**How the code uses the .parquet Data:**  
Once a full day is collected, the code will first look for the ATM Call &amp; Put Option Price that we want to sell. Then, the wings are selected in a way, so that both wings together cost only 10% of the Premium that we collected with the Short Put and Short Call. So for example, If the ATM Put gives you a premium of 1.56 and the AMT Call gives you a premium of 1.22, then together you get a premium of 2.78. 10% of that is 0.28, so both wings together are only allowed to cost 0.28. The code selects the wings that achieve this rule the closest (so it uses actual wings from the .parquet data instead of making them up). 

**The fees that I have used:**  
A backtest without including fees is no real backtest. So I have assumed a 1.50$ fee for every contract, as that seems to be the case on Interactive Brokers. This means, that for all 4 legs of the Short Iron Butterfly we have 6$ in fees that are taken away from our Equity no matter what happens on that day. 

**The Results in the Terminal for each Day:**

**Possible Explanations that I am unsure of:**  
ChatGPTs Opinion when asked about possible real world problems was like: Meh, Liquidity maybe? Maybe Slippage? Maybe slow execution time? Maybe you will get liquidated because Interactive brokers will forcibly auto close your Legs if you don't meet the required margin of 2.000$? Maybe the data from Yahoo Finance isn't as accurate as from the CBOE Data Shop (btw, the data for the SPY alone costs 2k, wow thats expensive). Also, if the Short Put/Call expires without you buying it back in the last minutes, you have Assignment risk, which can kill your portfolio over night. Maybe your timeframe is too short and you just happen to have a profitable timeframe?

So here I am looking for answers, do you guys have any ideas? I been learning much from this sub and I am sure you guys might know where I went wrong. Love to you all!"

Your Sample Size is a Joke
September 9 to October 17, 2025? That's maybe 27 trading days. You're basically saying ""I tested my parachute by jumping off my couch 27 times and it worked great!""
You know what didn't happen in your testing period?
* Federal Reserve surprise rate decisions
* Major bank failures (like SVB in March 2023)
* VIX spikes above 35
* Flash crashes (August 2024's Japan carry trade unwind hit 6% intraday)
* Earnings surprises from mega-cap stocks that move SPY 2%+
* Geopolitical shocks (remember when COVID first hit and SPY had multiple 5-10% days?)
Your backtest caught the market equivalent of ""sunny with light clouds"" weather. Cool. Now what happens during the hurricane?
The Math is Hilariously Bad
Let me break down what you're actually doing here:
""both wings together cost only 10% of the Premium that we collected""
So you collect $2.78 in premium, spend $0.28 on protection. That means:
* Maximum gain: ~$2.50 per contract (minus $6 fees = $2.44)
* Maximum loss: Depends on wing spacing, but looking at your purple lines, it's probably $15-50+ per contract
You're risking 20-30x your maximum gain.
This is literally the definition of a negative expectancy trade. You need to win 95%+ of the time just to break even over the long run. And spoiler alert: you won't win 95% of the time when volatility comes knocking.
Look at your own equity curve - you're grinding out $50-150/day profits, but those purple max-loss lines show potential $1,000+ losses. One bad day wipes out 2-3 weeks of gains.
Why This Strategy Has a 100% Historical Failure Rate
This isn't theoretical - this EXACT strategy (short vol, collect premium, minimal protection) has destroyed countless traders and funds:
OptionSellers.com (2018): Professional fund that sold options. Lost clients $150 million in a single November day when natural gas spiked. Guy had to release a crying YouTube video apologizing.
LJM Preservation and Growth Fund (Feb 2018): Down 82% in THREE DAYS during the Volmageddon event. $1+ billion fund, gone.
XIV ETF (Feb 2018): Short volatility ETF, lost 90%+ overnight and was liquidated. People had their entire retirement accounts in it.
The pattern is ALWAYS the same:
1. Make steady profits for months (just like your backtest)
2. Get confident, increase position size
3. Volatility event hits (happens 1-3 times per year)
4. Lose 6-12 months of profits in a single day
5. Either blow up completely or quit
The Real-World Execution Problems
1. Bid-Ask Spreads Explode During Volatility
Your backtest probably uses mid-prices or last-traded prices from Yahoo Finance. In reality:
* Calm market: SPY 0DTE spreads might be $0.05-0.10 per leg
* Volatile market: Spreads widen to $0.25-0.75 per leg
When you need to exit a losing position at 3:45pm because SPY just dropped 1.5%, you're paying the ASK to close your shorts and hitting the BID to sell your longs. That's $1-3 per contract in slippage across all four legs.
On a $2.78 credit, you just lost 40-100% of your profit to slippage. Your backtest doesn't account for this.
2. You Can't Exit When You Actually Need To
At 3:55pm on a volatile day, try getting filled on a 4-leg iron butterfly at reasonable prices. Market makers KNOW you're desperate. They'll quote you garbage. Your options:
* Eat massive slippage (50%+ of your credit)
* Let it expire and pray SPY doesn't land near your strikes (pin risk)
* Get assigned and wake up Monday with positions you didn't want
3. Yahoo Finance Data is Garbage for This
""This Data is collected via Yahoo Finance""
Yeah, no. Yahoo Finance options data is notoriously bad because:
* 15-minute delay means stale prices
* Shows last traded price, not real-time bid/ask
* Doesn't capture the actual order book depth
* Many strikes have zero volume and stale data
The reason CBOE DataShop costs $2,000 is because it's REAL exchange data with actual quotes. Your backtest is like planning a road trip using a map from 1995.
4. Pin Risk Will Destroy You
You're trading 0DTE that expires at 4:00pm. If SPY closes anywhere near your short strikes (within $0.50), you have massive pin risk:
* SPY closes at $580.05, your short call is $580
* You get assigned on the call (now short 100 shares)
* Your $582 long call expires worthless
* Monday morning SPY gaps up to $582
* You just lost $200 per contract overnight
This happens ALL THE TIME with 0DTE and it's not in your backtest.
5. Margin Calls at the Worst Possible Moment
At 3:45pm, SPY drops 1%. Your position shows a $2,000 unrealized loss. Interactive Brokers sees you're under margin requirements and force liquidates your position at market prices when spreads are widest.
You don't get a choice. You don't get to ""wait it out."" They close you out at the worst possible prices, locking in your loss.
This is literally in IB's margin policies - they can liquidate without notice.
What Your First Real Month Would Look Like
Days 1-8: ""Holy shit! I'm making $100-150/day! This is amazing!""Total: +$1,000
Day 9: Small loss, SPY moved 0.8% in last hour. Close at -$350.Total: +$650
Days 10-15: Back to winning. Confidence restored.Total: +$1,500
Day 16: CPI data comes in hot. SPY drops 1.5% in 30 minutes at 2:00pm. You try to close but spreads are 5x wider than normal. You panic. Close for -$1,800.Total: -$300
Days 17-20: Reduce size, scared. Make tiny gains.Total: +$100
Day 21: FOMC announcement. SPY volatility explodes. Your shorts go deep ITM. Margin call. IB liquidates you at terrible prices.Final loss: -$2,500
Account blown by 25% in less than a month.
The Statistical Reality Check
You need to backtest through these periods (at minimum):
* March 2020: COVID crash, SPY moved 5-10% daily
* February 2018: Volmageddon, VIX 15→50 overnight
* August 2024: Japan carry trade unwind, SPY dropped 3% in minutes
* March 2023: SVB banking crisis, massive intraday swings
* All of 2022: Constant 2-3% daily moves in bear market
I guarantee your strategy would have multiple -50% to -100% drawdowns in those periods. Not because the strategy is bad in theory, but because the risk/reward is fundamentally broken.
The Warning Signs You're Ignoring
Your own equity curve is screaming the problem at you:
* Small consistent gains: ✓ (classic premium selling)
* Occasional larger losses: ✓ (classic blow-up pattern forming)
* Maximum loss WAY bigger than maximum gain: ✓ (terrible risk/reward)
* Short time period: ✓ (haven't seen a real volatility event)
This is textbook ""works until it doesn't"" strategy.
What You Should Actually Do
If you're dead-set on doing this:
1. Backtest 2020-2025 minimum 
2. Paper trade for 3 months - Not backtest, LIVE paper trading to feel real execution
3. Risk max 1-2% per trade - If your account is $10K, risk $100-200 max
4. Skip high VIX days - If VIX &gt; 20, don't trade that day
5. Have mechanical stop loss - Close at -3x max gain, no exceptions
6. Don't trade around events - No trading on FOMC, CPI, NFP days
But honestly? Just don't do this. The math doesn't work. You're picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.
The Bottom Line Truth
Your backtest shows this works when:
* Markets are calm ✓
* Volatility is low ✓
* No major news events ✓
* SPY moves less than 1% ✓
Cool story. What happens when any of those conditions change? Because they WILL change. Regularly.
The question isn't ""can I make money in calm markets?"" It's ""what happens when the market isn't calm?""
Answer: You lose 10-20 days of gains in one trade. Then it happens again a month later. Then you quit with a blown account.
I'm not trying to be harsh - I'm trying to save you money. This strategy has a 100% failure rate over long enough time horizons. It's not if you blow up, it's when.
If you have $10K and you're willing to lose $3-5K learning this lesson the hard way, go ahead. But don't say nobody warned you when you lose 6 months of profits in a single Thursday afternoon because Powell said something unexpected.
The graveyard of retail traders is paved with profitable short-vol backtests.
Good luck, you're gonna need it."

2. Don't ask ChatGPT shit.

3. SPY often moves a lot in the last minutes, usually a sharp spike reversing the day's trend but also sometimes following it. Closing your positions 10 mins before market close may mitigate this. It's important to remember that options can be exercised after market close but you can't close your positions past that.

Mine were all started at like 10am per their mechanics, but i took too many losses and decided to stop. Their average profit on their back testing wasn't that much more than the size of the spread so I thought some of their returns were from their methodology of assuming mid price on their trades. "

But there are several real-world issues that simply don’t show up in a historical backtest pulled from Yahoo data.

Here are the biggest traps I’ve run into doing similar research:

**1. Your fills will almost never match last/mark prices in the real market.**  
SPX/SPY 0DTE spreads widen hard in the final 2–3 hours. What looks like a $2.78 credit in your data might actually be $2.40 or even $2.20 after real bid/ask slippage. Iron butterflies are extra sensitive because both wings + both shorts need tight markets to work.

**2. Gamma exposure is way nastier in real time.**  
Your backtest is using 1-minute candles. In real trading, you can get blown through your whole profit range in 10–15 seconds.  
That never shows up in a 1m bar.

**3. IV crush isn’t symmetrical.**  
0DTE IV can blow up in the last hour with *no news*. Even a 0.15 IV spike can totally destroy a short-fly for 20–30 minutes before it collapses again. Your backtest uses stale snapshots — so it never sees the *in-bar IV shock* that kills these trades.

**4. OCC assignment risk isn’t theoretical.**  
SPY is American-style — people exercise ITM early ALL the time on 0DTE.  
If you get even one leg assigned 2 minutes before close, your whole risk profile breaks.

**5. Liquidity isn’t uniform across wings.**  
Your wing selection algorithm chooses wings that match a 10% budget…  
…but out in the far OTM strikes, REAL markets have:

* wide spreads
* ghost volume
* no real market-maker interest You might “see” a $0.14 wing on Yahoo, but in live markets that wing doesn’t fill until $0.20+.

**6. Backtest assumes instant execution. Reality has delay.**  
Even 1–2 seconds of delay on a 0DTE multi-leg order can get you a completely different mark.

**7. Interactive Brokers uses SPY margin bursts.**  
Yes — they will auto-liquidate butterfly legs if margin spikes during a fast move.  
A lot of 0DTE traders have watched IB nuke a perfectly fine spread mid-day.

**8. Your sample size IS too small.**  
0DTE returns are extremely clustered. You may have accidentally captured the most mean-reverting period of the entire quarter.  
Two trending days can wipe out 20 mean-reverting wins.

None of this means your idea is bad — just that live execution and microstructure matter way more than many people realize.

Personally, I trade SPY directionally and built my own models/tools to help read intraday bias (free demo at **predixaweb.com**). Totally optional — just mentioning because testing strategies on SPY is honestly a rabbit hole.

But yeah — good on you for questioning the results. Most people don’t."

post,r/options,1nihewd,,1758029084,SZ0_,167,77.0,My First Big Options Trade: $6.2K Loss on $ATYR. A Painful but Valuable Lesson,"A few months ago, I started seeing posts pop up about a certain stock. At first, I brushed it off. But the more I read, the more I started to believe in the upside. I dismissed it a couple of times, but every few weeks, new DD would show up and pull me right back in.

Then people started posting their positions. Big ones. I’m talking thousands, hundreds of thousands, even multi-million dollar YOLOs. One of the names that stood out to me was Tweedle, the guy behind r/CountryDumb. I started following his posts, and that only deepened my conviction. By now, most of you probably know I’m talking about **$ATYR**.

Once I found r/Atyr_Alpha, I was completely sold.

# Quick Background (for those unfamiliar with $ATYR):

$ATYR is a biotech company that had already passed its Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. The Phase 3 data was a **make-or-break binary event**. While I did believe in the stock’s upside, I didn’t want to risk a large amount of money on what was essentially a coinflip. Analysts were saying it was roughly 60/40 odds.

So I got creative. I noticed that IV was absolutely juiced. Around **500%**  in anticipation of the trial results. I wanted to avoid directional risk, so I decided to play the inflated IV instead.

# The Trade:

* **Strategy**: Sell $2 Puts expiring Sept 19
* **Date Sold**: Sept 1
* **Stock Price at Entry**: \~$5
* **Contracts Sold**: 130
* **Premium Collected**: $0.41 per share
* **Total Premium**: $5,330
* **Break-even Price**: \~$1.60
* **Max Risk**: \~$20,800 (if stock went to $0)

**The Plan** was simple: Sell the puts, collect the premium, and rely on time decay to reach \~50% gains in about 10 days. I planned to **buy to close before the trial results dropped**.

It felt like a pretty safe bet. Sure, there was risk, but the stock dropping to zero before the data release felt highly unlikely. I expected to pocket a \~10% ROI in about 10 days, which sounded great.

# What Actually Happened:

To my surprise, **IV kept climbing**, completely wiping out any Theta gains. As we got closer to the trial date, IV shot above **1,000%**. I had never seen anything like it.

At that point, I realized I was stuck. I accepted that I’d probably have to hold through the binary event. Maybe a part of me hoped the data would drop *after* expiration, but no such luck.

**September 15th** I check my phone, and… horror.  
The stock **plummets 80% instantly**.  
From $6+ to $1 in a straight line.

I closed the position for a **$6,200 loss**.

That might not seem like much to some of you, but for me, that’s a serious hit. Still, I look back on it as a learning experience. No crying in the casino, right?

# What I'm Doing Now:

I’m back to the basics: CSPs, covered calls, and long-term buy and hold. This trade showed me I was in way too deep for my knowledge level. I need to take a step back and really understand the strategies before diving into high-risk setups again.

# Lessons Learned:

1. **Don’t ignore the bid/ask spread.** I rushed into selling my puts and left a lot of money on the table. In this case, it wouldn't have saved the trade, but it’s a habit I need to fix.
2. **I didn’t understand my Greeks as well as I thought.** Vega absolutely destroyed my Theta. I never even considered that could happen.
3. **Stay away from Biotech.** Everyone says it and stubborn as I am, I didn’t listen. Next time, I’ll treat it for what it is: a pure gamble.
4. **Focus more on your potential loss than your potential gain.** I did have an estimated max loss in mind (assuming $1/share, \~$6K loss), and I told myself I was okay with it. But when it actually hit, it hurt more than I expected. I stared myself blind on the upside and ignored how bad the downside would *feel*.

# Final Thoughts:

A few remarks from someone who’s been there (and perfectly know that he will be there again in a not so long future. You never stop making mistakes/errors, they just become less costly)  
  
1/ You thought you were selling time (theta). In reality you sold volatility into a binary. Vega &gt; theta every time. Especially in situation like this. Vega will not slowly drip into time. it is a binary event, it will get crushed.

2/ Naked puts on biotech are not avoiding direction, they are direction, plus short vega. Defined-risk spreads exist for a reason. I think this is the biggest mistake in your setup. Fix this one and you should be much better.  
  
3/ Size like you mean it. If a single coinflip can wipe weeks of gains, you’re too big. So halve it, and probably halve it again to be fine.  
  
4/ That one comes with experience but you should always model: what happens if IV doubles or triples? If that annihilates your P&amp;L, you are doing something wrong.

Painful lesson, but valuable. Now you know what you were really short. That’s how you survive long enough to play the next hand.  
Btw - biotech are fine to trade. Come back in a few weeks/months when you will have digested this one."

Obviously it would have been better to not lose money, but as long as the event isn't catastrophic in disabling your availability to make more money it's fine.

The real lesson is not risking everything on a single trade. The 1% rule is bullshit unless you have a high multi million account. For the rest of us 10-20% is a decent balance between not risking it all and making decent money.

comment,r/options,neocf8o,t3_1nihewd,1758101350,Party_Shoe104,1,,,"1) Number 3 (staying away from biotech) is the top lesson here. Biotechs are highly risky because they have nothing to fall back on (generating revenue/producing FCF, or have a huge stockpile of cash) if their drug does not pass all 3 trials. 

2) If for some odd reason you get lured into a biotech, the next line of defense (protecting your cash / minimizing loss) is position sizing. Instead of selling 130 contracts, you should have sold 26 - 30 contracts. In my opinion, it is way better to tell a story where you said ""I should have bought way more"" than feeling the pit in your stomach from experiencing a $6200 loss.

3) Only sell CSPs on quality stocks (ones that have quality fundamentals)....the ones you WANT to own, not the ones you HOPE can give you a quick financial gain. 

4) Speculation/hope is more of a gamble than it is a successful, long-term strategy (where probabilities are in your favor.)

Always look for the small to medium-sized wins where the probabilities are in your favor. The silver lining is that now....you have a tax loss event to balance the many small wins you will get from now until December."

I see so many comments and suggestions, but my experience is FDA result is binary event, so you can't do much, it just tossing a coin and expect outcome, no strategy works.  
Some time calendar spreads help to reduce the cost, if the FDA date is not clear and if it's in your favor, but most of the time, option sellers know approximate time, so the premium would be higher, so not much advantage, just a gable."

You bought into hype and should have expected IV to rise as the event drew closer, which is why being short options pre-event is a losing proposition almost by default unless you hedge or structure carefully.  This scenario is just a more juiced version of a really hyped earning report and the option activity played the same way.  You made one of the riskiest bets in this situation and severely underestimated how much you bleed Vega even while collecting theta. 

A calendar spread here is also just too risky. Your long hold is probably near worthless after the event on negative news. I doubt I'd straddle this situation because we are talking about biotech and I wouldn't be confident that the price move could be easily defined for my risk. I guess you could iron condor this to define your risk. But what you did was absolutely directional even if you didn't see it that way."

Your next mistake was choosing $2 puts. The failure was in risk management. The company if it failed the next step was worth ~$0.80. You could’ve calculated this yourself and then seen if $1 strike was selling for &gt;$0.20 which I don’t believe it was. 

You probably should’ve closed when IV doubled and you got concerned as it demonstrated you had no conviction or confidence in your position. If you had either, you would’ve sold more puts. 


Source: someone who sold $12 calls and made out like a bandit, and have done so successfully on a handful of biotech / pharma over the last couple years. When there’s a big one, I usually try to get involved. 


You may want to consider a short strangle or short iron condors I think. Basically sell a call and put spread. Best is when the net premiums extend your break even price down to &lt;$1.0 on the put side and super high (&gt;100%) on the call side.


But yes kudos for the write up and trying to learn. You only learn from failures so hopefully you learn something on this one that makes you better prepared for next time."

Usually when the stock is in a correction or slight dip. The market doesn't price these with too much confidence, hence the lower premiums. If the stock price rises, the option usually does too. If you buy ones that are slightly out of the money but have an expiration after an earnings date, for example, the stock may experience a surge based on optimism and the contract will usually rise along with it. You sell when market hype is high, and buy when it's low. 

There are a bunch of strategies, but this one is fairly basic.

Edit: these are usually a couple months out, so the time value is still high when there's more time for the stock to move."

Tips:

Don’t buy options sell them

Progression of your learning should go as follows 
1. Buy and sell stocks
2. Learn Option Anatomy (Greeks and IV)
3. Cash Secured Puts and Covered Calls
4. Basic Spreads (vertical,horizontal,diagonal)
5. LEAPS options (options with leverage)

You can use one or all of these strategies. 

The odds say if you only buy options you will go broke. Some don’t but most do. 

The ideas mentioned above, time is your friend. That’s the biggest rule of investing I’ve learned. 

Buying options you are fighting time and you will lose."

You can still get good risk to reward like three to one, and it's not gonna evaporate suddenly like a short dated call or puts. If you don't understand what I'm talking about then I highly recommend starting from the basics. I listened to most of the options alpha podcasts which can give you a good base understanding, and then I listen to a lot of tasty trade options trading concepts show. At first, you probably won't understand most of what they're saying. Once you do then you're ready to go."

second question, 0dtes are very very risky because of the theta decay. if you're hot and heavy to be in and out quickly, i recommend buying weekly throws, like 3-4DTE positions. i personally like this method because if i don't end up selling the first day, i have a day or two to find a good exit. 

i exclusively swing trade qqq, sometimes scalp depending on the market. and i never full port into one single
position, this was a mistake i had to learn the hard way. for example, if you have 1000$ in your portfolio, dropping 800$ on an 0dte is a fast way to destroy it all. yes you can get lucky and double it but the risk far outweighs the potential award, and that point you are gambling. don't rush into anything. do research on the tickers you choose, zoom out and look for patterns in movement and price action , pay attention to the news obsessively, i cannot tell you how
many times i lost
money simply because i wasn't paying attention to the news and macroeconomics. be patient and go slowly"

It took me probably 3 years of trading to become profitable, and an incredible amount of work on discipline, patience, basic human psychology and self-awareness, studying market structure, learning about current regimes and how they come and go, joining trading groups, learning backtesting, taking brakes, etc. Also, ask chat gpt for help... it's actually got very reasonable advice."

Also, while it's definitely not beginner-friendly, learn how to do multi-leg options (condors, spreads).  Done correctly, the odds are much more heavily in your favor, and if you set up stops on one or both sides of the trade (depending on the structure of it) you limit your risk that much further.

Pick up some beginners guides, watch good channels.  If you want a book that is also definitely not beginner-friendly, but will also explain in incredible detail, I'd recommend 'Options as a Strategic Investment' (Lawrence G. McMillan). It'll run you about 70 on Amazon, another 20 if you get the study guide, and you'll probably bash your head against it for weeks or months before things start to click...

With these strategies you collect premium as income and the way you make money is when the contracts you’re selling become worthless.

You can't add more positions because the company is out of business and going through bankruptcy proceedings. They folded... and their stock is delisted. This actually makes the call worthless... and you don't need to invoke the Greeks to figure this out. The intrinsic value of a $1 call is $0, since the stock is nowhere near $1 and never will be. The extrinsic value is also $0, because there’s no chance the stock recovers — the company is effectively done.   
  
But... you did rightly point out a Robinhood glitch. Your call is absolutely not worth $552. Robinhood is just struggling to show an accurate amount because the stock is delisted and there is no options liquidity. If I had to guess, Robinhood is probably trying to use an incomplete dataset to display the value of the call."

The first is **PSTV**, their main product is in cancer testing. They recently signed a contract with UNH, have solid fundamentals, are almost debt-free, have good cash flow, and even receive government grants.

The second is **FEMY**, which focuses on female fertility products. Their product is already commercialized in Europe and Australia, and they’re now waiting for FDA approval in the U.S. Both stocks are currently trading under $1, and all major platforms rate them as ‘Strong Buy.’

That said, always do your own DD. Penny stocks, especially in biotech and pharma, are very risky. Personally, I believe both have legit products, now it’s all about execution. If things go well, their long-term upside could be huge.

One more thing to keep in mind: since they’re both under $1, there’s always a risk of delisting, and companies often do reverse splits to avoid that, which isn’t necessarily a good sign. So be mindful of that risk too."

It depends. Risk level is 100% of the context when it comes to investing. If you want incredibly low risk, investing in safe corporate/treasury bonds might be your best bet. If you want the average level of risk, invest in various ETFs that track various things like the S&amp;P 500, Med./Small cap stocks, Emerging Markets, Foreign Companies, etc. If you're comfortable with a riskier option, blue-chip stocks are probably the way to go. There are higher risk levels you can go with, but, as you're a beginner, I don't even feel comfortable being the one to give you that information. Get comfortable with what you have now before you start trying to play with other things, or there's a high chance you'll lose most of your investment.  
As for specific tickers, I would personally choose different ETFs (for long-term, medium-risk, consistent growth)  
SPY, VOO, VWO, SPMO, SCHG, VTI, VUG, and anything else that is relatively close to this should be a pretty decent idea. You're very likely going to get decent growth, especially if you consistently invest over a long time (please do not try to time the market). 

All in all, it can be quite confusing at first; however, there are nearly infinite resources out there to help you accomplish your goals. I would advise to simply watch highly-viewed youtube videos on the topic, as they can be an excellent building block to get you where you need to be. There are even things like Robinhood's managed portfolio, which has (so far) generated solid returns for me with the little bit I threw in there out of curiosity.

Good luck to you. Remember, there is no ""short-cut"" to wealth. Consistency is key."

If I had $2k and didn’t know what to invest in, I’d probably just do an ETF. Many will say VOO, which tracks the S&amp;P500 index. Others may say QQQM, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 ex financial companies."

The one ticker that has remained steady for 7 years is SOXL. Do the research, learn how this ETF is ""weighted"", why it's had to be split twice (in the time I've seen so far) because too much growth makes it too expensive for retail investors, why it lags behind a bit and how to take advantage of market shifts, and most of all why semiconductors rule the world. Also is cool trading it's mirror SOXS when the market is red. Don't be a ""bull"" or a ""bear"" in mindset, there's money to be made going up and down. Getting locked in to the ""just a little higher then I'll pull out..."" Mindset is how you lose everything to the ""it can't drop any further, I shouldn't sell"" mindset.
Learn about the Dead Cat Bounce, why buying the bottom is impossible, and why you need Support from 3 bounces before it's less of a gamble to try.
I've made about 40k off SOXL alone, with about 10k invested. I tend to make the most when I set a reoccurring buy and forget about it. My current position was purchased at $22. 

The COVID crash and rebound was a huge learning opportunity for me. Potential for trump to ruin things again, so definitely learn about ""trailing stop loss"" orders for peace of mind at your day job."

They’ve been growing their Bitcoin mining power fast, adding more machines and expanding their sites, so when Bitcoin price jumps, their profits can go up big time too. What’s even more interesting is they’re not just sticking to mining anymore — they’re starting to move into AI and high performance computing stuff, using their existing power setups to host data centers. That could turn into a steady stream of money instead of just relying on crypto prices. They also got into the U.S. market more lately, buying Stronghold Digital and getting access to cheaper electricity, which helps cut costs a lot. Since most of their energy is from renewables, they’re also less at risk from big price swings in power. If Bitcoin goes back up and their AI plans actually work out, Bitfarms might easily become one of those companies people look back on and say, “wish I bought that earlier.”"

Most of these stocks are doing well for the past year and the past five years. 

I disperse about $200 into these stocks per month, trying to prioritize buying in whenever the market is low. 

Every 6 months I reevaluate what stocks I think I should hold, and maybe replace them with ones I have more confidence in.

I would recommend holding off on high dividend investments this early on. The best strategy is to go straight index fund, set it and forget it. But later on you may want to start putting a little bit of money into individual stocks that you have high conviction in

I like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and VOO just to name a few. Most people are looking for the next big stock to blow instead of making the $$$ they already have work for them with well known growth companies. I could be wrong but that choice of stocks might not do much. Also find a balance in the stocks you choose, for example I told you I like Google, Amazon and Microsoft which are all tech stocks so if you only buy these then there is no balance so add stock healthcare to your portfolio, add a energy etf to your portfolio or if all of this is confusing just buy VOO every chance you get and you will be fine.

This year ive moved my portfolio to almost entirely commoditiy based (Precious metals, mining, lithium) and i currently have a 41% ytd return."

post,r/RobinHood,1oth93t,,1762789653,deveousdevil,6,43.0,Confusion over the $1000 free Margin,"Hi, novice investor here. So I want to access the interest free margin on RH. right before I signed up for Gold, I added about $1300 into my account as this would essentially make the membership free because of the high yield savings rate. I paid for annual and saved $10 as well.

I planned to always have just that amount plus a couple hundred extra for whatever securities I buy. But now, I've read here that my account has to be ZERO before the margin starts getting used. I put a borrowing limit of $1000 so I dont accidentally use interest charging margin. 

So do I have to now have to put my money BACK into my original bank (I dont want to invest that much of my own money right now). Then once im at zero, start buying stocks until I hit my $1000 limit...then AGAIN transfer my $1300 (plus little extra) buffer?? 

And the margin maintenance is fluctuating at about $2700. Is that how much cash I need to have in the account or how much my whole portfolio needs to be worth to avoid a margin call? I have a little under 10k invested. 

(So my investments would have to drop like 70% before they make me pay the margin back? Or liquidate my holdings?)

I assume once I spend that margin the maintenance will go up because I have more invested. Does a margin call happen if a particular stock collapses? Or if my whole portfolio goes down?

Lastly, how exactly do I pay the margin back? I wanted to do it manually in small increments over a few months while still investing separately. Is that not possible? Does RH automatically put any money I transfer into paying off the loan before I can really invest again with my own money?

Thank you all."

comment,r/RobinHood,no5mp3d,t3_1oth93t,1762802383,Street-Comparison-45,5,,,"First I want to say l, that if you have any doubt or questions about using margin, then it’s better to be safe than sorry. 
  I did something very similar. So there was a recent update that allows you to have multiple brokerage accounts. One can hold your cash and earn interest and the other can be setup with using the margin. I’m a gold member and also have my borrowing limit set to $1,000 and always keep $.01-.99 uninvested just to stay below the $1,000. 
  As others have said, there is a risk to margin and you could receive a margin call. My $1,000 is put into SGOV which does not grow and yields a little under 4% in dividends. Relatively safer but low upside"

Just because RH doesn't charge you interest on the first $1000 doesn't mean it is not borrowing.  It is still borrowing, and you can borrow only if you don't have your own money to use for whatever you are purchasing."

comment,r/RobinHood,no6d636,t3_1oth93t,1762810436,GhostTypeDragon,3,,,"You won’t earn interest on a margin borrowing limit because you aren’t using it until you’ve bought something with it. I’m guessing someone told you that gold membership is free because $1000 dollars at 4% (ish) interest nets to $50 per year.

The way they do this is by buying an etf that has a stable price and letting that etf earn the interest for you, however, you can’t use this margin balance to buy said etf unless you’ve already spent your actual cash balance.

Since you aren’t ready to invest your actual cash balance, and since your actual cash balance has to be invested before you can use the free margin, the $1000 free margin is of no use to you.

Also, without at least $2000 in your account of your own money, they won’t even let you use the margin balance in the first place.

With all that being said, turn off margin and read up on how this all works. You are a novice investor and likely to get burned if you blindly rush into this."

Your margin maintenance depends on what’s in your account, you will need to look in the margin details page to see what you have already and what is needed for maintenance.

You can pay it back by adding cash from your bank, but your margin loan will also decrease from dividends, credits from options selling, etc."

You can use the free margin and get cash back at the same time if you (1) open a new cash account and put your excess cash there and (2) keep over $2000 in your margin account. You can have around 12 “accounts” all in the same Robinhood account, but only one can use margin. 

Keep your most secure investments in that margin account - things like bonds and diversified ETFs like VTI, VXUS, VOO. Keep the $1000 in margin in a treasury yield etf like SGOV or USFR. That will let you see how the margin works with your account value without putting much at risk."

post,r/RobinHood,1nkogab,,1758239937,umirinbrah29,4,5.0,"Advice, Options vs Margin?","Hi all,

I'll preface this by saying trading isn't my forte, I'm pretty active in picking stocks and industries, but have limited experience in TA and generally hold stocks for the long term.

That being said, rightly or wrongly I'd consider myself far less risk averse than the average person, I've utilised 0% cards and in some cases low interest debt to essentially leverage further purchases and slowly pay off the cards/loans.

To me this seems like balanced risk as, as long as I can make payments, and I can beat the interest rate over the duration... essentially it was a good decision. Even if markets drop, I own the stock and can hold indefinitely without any liquidation risk.

This then brings me to margin trading which has caught my attention recently, 1.25x/1.5x margin seems like an easy way to leverage yourself cheaply, as long as you factored in margin call risk and add to buffer if needed during downturns. The slight risk of margin call and continued interest burden is a bit disconcerting... but I can get on board with the idea.

Why is it that options seem to be by far the most popular thing to do, when from even my risk tolerant eyes... they look absolutely mental on the risk curve? I get the ""defined risk"" in the contracts opposed to a completely margin call... but the thought of options potentially expiring worthless, I may bet in the right direction but lose thousands to theta decay, or it not going far enough in said direction... it just seems like it isnt worth the pay off to me. 

So what gives, why does it feel like 99% of WSB types on reddit seem to trade options and I never see margin plays? What's your personal reason for liking options? 

Sorry for the complete waffle... would love to be convinced as to why options are superior to margin though, or just provoke some discussion and any tips either way.

Thanks!"
comment,r/RobinHood,nf0wo4q,t3_1nkogab,1758261497,[deleted],2,,,Because 99% people trade stock market as the casino
comment,r/RobinHood,nf27h93,t3_1nkogab,1758285539,chatrep,1,,,"I am sort of weird. The risk averse part of me avoids margin and futures. I always want to know my absolute risk and never want to deal with a “margin call.”

But then the aggressive investor in me favors options. But I never do very short term or far OTM.

For instance of a stock is $100, I might buy a $90 call that expires Jan26.

For a conservative play, I might do the same with Jan27.

Then even more conservative which is what I am shifting to is buying shares of moderate volatility, higher growth stocks and wheeling. So I am selling cash secured puts to enter positions and selling covered calls when I have the stocks. This has been consistently adding an extra ~15% or so to the underlying including being exercised.

I am currently wheeling CRSP, HOOD, ASTS, TSM, RDDT, SMR. (Gives you an idea of the growth/volatility but I have strong multi-year conviction with this assortment). So this is my “conservative” play but it’s not as safe as something like VOO/VTI. I don’t like wheeling lower volatility stocks as premium is negligible.

Oh… most my trading is in an IRA so I don’t need to worry about short term gains or being exercised.

My next level down in risk is just an index fund like VOO or but more aggressive QQQ."
comment,r/RobinHood,nf3ok1g,t3_1nkogab,1758301477,lan1990,-1,,,Options any day..u can limit your losses with sound strategies.
post,r/RobinHood,1oolrc4,,1762296011,Eatyourfriedrice,2,17.0,Trying to get some input .,"I’ve been putting $270 a week into my ira and $50-$60 a week into my regular brokerage account. Should I spread out into other investments or keep on the path I’m in? Also thinking of playing with crypto maybe tossing $10-$20 a week into it, anyone have any recommendations on that front?"
comment,r/RobinHood,nn5wz7n,t3_1oolrc4,1762307187,spenga,21,,,Well first max out your Ira before your taxable account.
comment,r/RobinHood,nn6vft6,t3_1oolrc4,1762320418,Whole_Avocado5867,12,,,Dude what you have now is fine it’s just a red day today. It happens.
comment,r/RobinHood,nn6thkk,t3_1oolrc4,1762319519,rrickk18,6,,,"U don’t need to be putting into both VTI and VOO, just pick one. they move almost identical it’s just that VTI also has mid and small cap companies."
comment,r/RobinHood,nn79hlt,t3_1oolrc4,1762327819,CaptSwayze,5,,,Why hold VOO and VTI in the same account?
comment,r/RobinHood,nn9fizy,t3_1oolrc4,1762360254,Mostly-Toastly22,4,,,"IRA annual limit is $7,000. Looks like you just got started a couple months ago considering the balance there, so fine to keep contributing at that level for the rest of the year. Reduce the weekly contribution into your IRA to $134 next year to stay within the limit. 

Already got an emergency fund in place? If you're working, are you contributing to your 401k?"
comment,r/RobinHood,nnw97qe,t3_1oolrc4,1762672131,KT_WV,1,,,Let me help here… only buy VOO. You don’t need to buy both no single stocks pointless when you own VOO &amp; max the IRA #1.
comment,r/RobinHood,nnyse5j,t3_1oolrc4,1762710981,arctick_nomad,1,,,"There is a lot of crossover in your port. At least in my opinion. VTI and VOO are usually not good to have both of. The top holdings are almost identical so you’re just double dipping. It’s usually suggested to do something like VXUS with voo for international exposure. Vanguard themselves just came out with a statement suggesting international exposure going into the next few years. Plus your single stocks you hold are already large portions of vti and voo. It’s up to you but, it could be better invested in non tech stocks that are not top of the voo and vti etf."

comment,r/RobinHood,nnbqqeh,t3_1oolrc4,1762384282,plantxdad420,1,,,"choose between either VOO or VTI, not both and if you’re investing ETFs in that sector you don’t really need to invest in individual tech stocks as it’s redundant. diversify through ETFs first (ie VXUS, ICLN or AVUV) and pick up some bond investments (BND or BNDX) for stability."
comment,r/RobinHood,nnhbcga,t3_1oolrc4,1762461135,Runaway_Goliath,1,,,Think about adding international like SCHF
comment,r/RobinHood,nncs0zv,t3_1oolrc4,1762397442,ululonoH,1,,,Small and mid cap. Dividend etfs. Food staples etf.

post,r/RobinHood,1nizcb6,,1758070891,lvl99cooking,2,11.0,Is this redundant? Holdings help,"I’m relatively new to investing, over the past year I’ve seen different videos from creators claiming “the best” things to hold on to.

Because of different videos, I’ve had recurring investments purchasing VOO &amp; SPY both.. but now that I’ve actually looked into it, is it silly to be purchasing both?

If so, which should I stop the recurring investment, &amp; what should I replace it with? 
Thoughts?

Thank you!"
comment,r/RobinHood,nemu7eu,t3_1nizcb6,1758074304,RealSoil3d,4,,,"Yes, just buy VOO since it has lower fees

It’s true the best thing to do is holding, I sold Palantir at $60 and sold quantum stocks when they’re under $3, I would have made much more money holding them 😢"
comment,r/RobinHood,nenapnk,t3_1nizcb6,1758080788,Odd_Application_3824,3,,,"You are technically buying the same investment. Not necessarily silly but not really necessary.  VOO has a lower expense ratio but not by much. 

Personally I would just pick one.  Is this in a taxable brokerage? If it is, I wouldn't worry about drilling selling one. Don't want to trigger capital gains tax, but just pick one moving forward."
comment,r/RobinHood,nenh8yi,t3_1nizcb6,1758083746,Western-Run2830,3,,,They do exactly the same thing. Stick with VOO for the lower expense ratio.
comment,r/RobinHood,nenibdp,t3_1nizcb6,1758084249,memelordzarif,2,,,Yes it is redundant. I would (and do) hold VOO since they have slightly lower expenses ratio with slightly higher dividends. It’s very minimal but still a win regardless for essentially keeping the exact same investments.
comment,r/RobinHood,netg0qf,t3_1nizcb6,1758161669,Adventurous_Mud_5721,2,,,"Ditch both and get SPLG for even lower fees.  Honestly it doesn't hurt to have two, it just doesn't help either.  When more doesn't help just go with simplicity."
comment,r/RobinHood,nen9jce,t3_1nizcb6,1758080298,Rockatansky77,1,,,"Keep VOO. SPY is good if you were buying options. Remember VOO is 500 companies out of the 4,000 trading in the market. Some people are fine with that. I prefer to have a total market ETF like VTI or VT. I also have QQQM and SPLG which is the same as VOO but cheaper."
comment,r/RobinHood,nenmqhy,t3_1nizcb6,1758086414,need2sleep-later,1,,,"I don't understand those who blindly follow whatever is recommended in YouTube or tiktok videos or places like reddit/discord/etc. without doing an ounce of research work to understand what they are putting their money on?  Spend some time learning about investing.  How to do research.   Develop a plan, define goals, and how to reach them."
post,r/RobinHood,1n9dx70,,1757098919,Street_Yak_6845,4,8.0,"Using margin to purchase high dividend, high risk ETF","Looking to tap into 70% of margin total, around $35k and buy 1000 shares of a high dividend stock. Knowing the price will fluctuate, and likely go down, even tank, I'm curious to know what others have experienced who maybe did something like this and had their stock price dip enough for RH to come knocking and even start selling your assets.

"
comment,r/RobinHood,ncpvuff,t3_1n9dx70,1757159775,ArmyITDuvall,13,,,"I’ll personally never use margin again… 

It makes you risk selling at a loss rather than hold it out during bad economic times. 

It’s a lot more stressful when stock go down rather than just relaxing and waiting till they go back up again.

But please do update us"
comment,r/RobinHood,ncp3w7z,t3_1n9dx70,1757143786,DataRadiant5008,4,,,"at 70% margin you can probably incur a 30% drawdown before you get margin called. Also dividends in general aren’t very great, they aren’t tax efficient and typically aren’t growth companies (dividends aren’t free money because they come out of the share price). Heed my advice."
comment,r/RobinHood,ncv7t3h,t3_1n9dx70,1757229147,buenotc,4,,,"I swear, every week, someone on reddit has a variation of your bright idea.  Figure out the arbitrage in your favor and share with us your process.  It's not that it can't work. It's just that the possibility is not in your favor."
comment,r/RobinHood,ncm0kx8,t3_1n9dx70,1757101046,Junior-Appointment93,4,,,I’m only using margin for CSP’s on certain stocks. I’m making more doing that then high dividend/Risky ETF’s played that game and got out.
comment,r/RobinHood,ndlzjpd,t3_1n9dx70,1757586257,PreparationH692,1,,,I’ve changed my strategy from the beginning of the year to investing in a handful of companies that issue a dividend to just one fund. I have found the key is putting $$$ in over time to avoid a large sum affecting the average price of the security. This acts as a buffer against any loss while boosting the increase. Identify an amount and use your margin to close the gap on you goal and what you have invested with your own funds already. Your goal should not be to milk as much out the ex date as possible. Dividends at long term investments.

comment,r/RobinHood,nifj2us,t3_1o1ay8n,1759935164,secondbushome,0,,,"You are effectively loaning shares to short sellers. What you receive depends on the stock and how many shares are loaned out. The risk is, in some extreme scenario, if the short seller gets liquidated bc they couldn’t cover, you would only get back the collateral they put up, which could be worth less than the shares lent out."

post,r/RobinHood,1onmmdj,,1762200862,Original-Pass8413,1,8.0,Looking for opinions on my investments,"Currently investing in SPMO, VOO, VTI, QQQ, and NVDA. Is this good? Should I concentrate the ETFs down into one or two? Or expand into others? "
comment,r/RobinHood,nmz5n36,t3_1onmmdj,1762216037,Coffeedrip916,2,,,"Those are good, if you want to generate income I would add in Jepi and Jepq. You pretty much get a hybrid etf with a high yield from options and decent returns. If you want more growth JEPQ will be your go to since it follows the nasdaq.

If you have extra money at this current moment I would go in on Robinhood, HOOD.

Earnings is on Wednesday for HOOD and it will have a huge breakout after beating earnings. It’s pretty obvious they will have a massive earnings call since the prediction market has given them a huge boost in revenue"

comment,r/RobinHood,nn9gy5o,t3_1onmmdj,1762360660,Mostly-Toastly22,1,,,"There's a lot of overlap here tbh - 4 US equity ETFs with different flavours and 1 US tech co. Lots of tech concentration and US concentration. I'd think about balancing some of your US exposure with international exposure, and taking out 1 or 2 of the overlapping US ETFs just for simplicity's sake."
comment,r/RobinHood,nnytce8,t3_1onmmdj,1762711244,arctick_nomad,1,,,There’s no reason to have voo with vti and nvidia. Nvidia is already highly weighted in both vti and voo. Plus vti and voo are very similar to the point your just double dipping owning both. Vanguard just came out and recommended USA investors to start diversifying into international etfs like vxus in the coming years. Saying that the market is looking to slump heavy domestically. I wouldn’t have vti and voo and nvidia. Choose vti or voo and use hush that. Then add in non tech growth stocks or dividend singles if you want. But vxus and voo seem like a solid balance depending on your goals.

With all the federal employees about to get backpay and a little higher volume into their IRA’s and 401(k)s paired with Black Friday coming up and the general market-go-uppetude of the holiday season I’m feeling hella bullish on QQQ and SPY. Personally filling up my options portfolio with SPYM calls (too poor for SPY) at $81, $82, and $83. Just trying to make up my mind on 9 or 37 DTE. 9 is short for Black Friday but 37 is WAY too long."

post,r/RobinHood,1nmu53i,,1758466643,Jo_money,0,14.0,"Never shorted a company before but considering Disney, thoughts?","With the recent cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel’s show and the larger conversations happening around free speech and the First Amendment, I’ve been wondering if Disney might be in a vulnerable spot.

Do you think the fallout from Kimmel’s exit (and the perception of political/ideological pressure on entertainment companies) could meaningfully impact Disney’s stock in the near or medium term? Or is this just noise compared to Disney’s bigger drivers (parks, streaming, ESPN, etc.)?

I’m considering whether shorting Disney is a smart move here, but I’d like to hear other perspectives before making any decisions. Also, as of right now I hate the stock.

post,r/pennystocks,1oc8d1v,,1761039020,repmadness,1846,218.0,"BYND outlook, something is happening for sure","I think this def has potential to get higher although i think it would be smart to exit before earnings honestly

**some key stats to take in:**

* 11/05 earnings date
* call volume hit 1.18M vs only 309K puts (0.26 put/call ratio). thats not normal hedging thats pure degen speculation
* big positive gamma support sitting right at $1.00, could act as a floor
* above $1.55 = negative gamma zone, this is where dealer hedging can actually accelerate moves instead of dampening them
* if price breaks and holds above $1.55 theres a clear path to $1.80-$2.00 where more negative gamma sit

options flow:

* massive call additions across the board, both weekly lottos AND long dated LEAPS
* put interest bleeding off
* call skew is inverted (unusual for a distressed stock), everyones betting UP
* IV structure front loaded into the 11/05 earnings

what could happen:

* base case: if call buying cools we drift back toward $1 into fridays 10/24 OPEX (max pain = $1)
* if we hold above $1.55 with continued call flow negative gamma kicks in and we could rip to $2+ fast
* downside: breaks below $1 and its probly fucked

not financial advice obviously but the gamma setup is looking spicy. "

2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠The volume is insane and almost 400 million after market open in 60 minutes. Momentum will squeeze the shorts out.
3.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Earnings in 14 days have all the hallmarks of big news, including Walmart, and who knows, other big retailers to follow.

Net revenue is expected to be approximately $70 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, which is in line with the Company’s previous guidance range of $68 million to $73 million.

•Gross margin is expected to be in the range of approximately 10% to 11% for the three months ended September 27, 2025, inclusive of approximately $1.7 million of expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China. Excluding these charges, gross margin is expected to be in the range of approximately 12% to 13%.

•Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of approximately $41 million to $43 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, inclusive of approximately $2 million of charges related to certain non-routine items, including incremental legal expenses associated with a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer, amortization of certain retention program expenses and costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s campus headquarters building. Excluding these charges, operating expenses are expected to be in the range of approximately $39 million to $41 million.

•In addition to and not included in the preliminary estimates above, **the Company expects to record a non-cash impairment charge for the three months ended September 27, 2025, related to certain of its long-lived assets.** The Company’s recoverability test, conducted in accordance with ASC 360, preliminarily indicated that the carrying amount of certain of its long-lived assets was not recoverable from the projected undiscounted future cash flows of the relevant asset group. Although the impairment charge is expected to be material, the Company is not yet able to reasonably quantify the amount at this time."

post,r/pennystocks,1nwujdz,,1759484200,gregw134,648,246.0,$Buru CEO is a Serial Diluter,"I know, this isn’t exactly groundbreaking news on this sub. A couple people asked me to look at Nuburu and I enjoyed the research so I thought I’d make a post on it.

Most of the content is buried in here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1814215/000095017025112269/buru-20250829.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1814215/000095017025112269/buru-20250829.htm)

**Nuburu pre-2025**

So Nuburu *was* a real company, probably. They made “blue lasers” and an “extreme-brightness AI™ laser”. By 2024 they ran out of cash, the founder quit, and they stopped filing quarterly reports. The debt holders took their patents as collateral. They stopped paying their workers who quit. By 2025 the company is just a financial shell. (page 33)

**Alessandro Zamboni is a Serial Diluter**

In 2025 Nuburu somehow got taken over by this guy:

https://preview.redd.it/8wytfvdq8vsf1.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c9d374a94820c6044e3689941903a009e7c642a

Alessandro’s last company was Supply@Me Capital

https://preview.redd.it/9caztbmr8vsf1.png?width=1999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c5340300b8089f9af8fedc46a00417393af479

Supply@Me deploys state of the art technologies like AI, IoT, Blockchain and cloud to create a new asset class, monetized inventory which leverages

https://preview.redd.it/kvfl8xut8vsf1.png?width=1742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff145d1832f80c34c2d578a6aaf27abbbc5dcda8

https://preview.redd.it/veukecuu8vsf1.png?width=1999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee2fee739acddcacc33c1b79f3408c4d6e28e5b1

SYME issued 72B shares and stopped filing in 2023. 

**Alessandro dilutes Nuburu Shareholders Round 1**

Alessandro becomes CEO of Nuburu in 2025 (somehow) and immediately dilutes the stock:

https://preview.redd.it/yk6wayiw8vsf1.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b977a094fb1a753ca03710b2c9166f5f6810311

From the filing, that dilution raised $5.14M. Then Nuburu makes a $5.15M investment into SYME. Money gets sucked out of Nuburu and into a company Alessandro controls. (page F-35)

**Dilution Round 2, Italian Edition**

Nuburu reverse splits and raises $12M more from the public. Naturally, he’s going to dilute the company again. This time the scheme is to acquire an Italian defense company.

Suspiciously, it’s not Nuburu that’s going to acquire the Italian company, it’s a special purpose shell company called TCEI S.a.r.l. It contains a random software company called Orbit that Alessandro owned. Nuburu pays Alessandro $1.35M to put Orbit into the shell company. Then Nuburu writes a $25M IOU to buy 20% of the shell company. Btw, it’s never mentioned who owns the other 80%, but it’s possible Alessandro controls it. (page 37)

Nuburu doesn’t have $25M, but it states right in the filings that the plan is to dilute shareholders to raise that money, by issuing shares and convertible notes. I also want to point out that since Orbit is in the shell company, there is a direct path to funnel money to Alessandro. Nuburu -&gt; shell company -&gt; Orbit -&gt; Alessando. 

Anyways, what we know for certain is that shareholders are going to be diluted to acquire 20% of a shell company that has a random SaSS the CEO owns. That shell company has concepts of a plan to acquire a random Italian defense company. Notice the weasel words:

“today announced it has signed an agreement with a key strategic partner to establish a framework for evaluating a controlling interest acquisition…”

An agreement to establish a framework for evaluating an acquisition. Compelling.

It’s all very confusing and hard to follow, and that’s the point. Spin the shells and make a distraction while the money slips under the table.

**Conclusion**

Alessandro diluted shareholders in his last company. He already diluted $BURU shareholders once this year and sent the money to his own company. Now he's shuffling money out of Nuburu and into opaque shell companies. Don’t give this guy any more money please. "

comment,r/pennystocks,nhpxje0,t3_1nwujdz,1759586785,MrMarket2022,11,,,"This interpretation is way off — it mixes a few facts with a lot of guesswork.

The $5.15M “transfer” to SYME wasn’t money disappearing — it was a strategic equity investment into a fintech platform that’s now key to BURU’s closed-loop defense-finance model. SYME provides debt-free monetisation of Tekne’s hardware inventory, allowing BURU Defense to scale manufacturing without traditional bank debt. That’s not siphoning funds, that’s building recurring revenue.

The “TCEI S.a.r.l.” structure isn’t shady — it’s a standard SPV (special purpose vehicle) used in EU-US cross-border acquisitions. Orbit was included for its digital IP layer, not to hide assets. The staged 20% stake is phase one ahead of regulatory approval (Golden Power clearance) before full Tekne acquisition.

Everything mentioned — investments, related parties, and tranches — is fully disclosed in SEC filings under GAAP. There’s zero evidence of money “slipping under the table.”

Meanwhile, BURU’s laser tech, Tekne’s €500M+ defense backlog, and SYME’s monetisation platform together form a unique defense-fintech ecosystem. That’s why institutional attention is picking up.

Always worth reading the filings yourself — not just one-sided Reddit “summaries.”"

comment,r/pennystocks,nhps38g,t3_1nwujdz,1759584890,MrMarket2022,5,,,"People love to throw shade at Zamboni for his involvement in startups like SYME — yes, there’s been dilution, and yes, the road’s been bumpy. But let’s be real: every game-changing idea goes through chaos before it clicks.

What makes Zamboni different is that he’s trying to connect fintech with real industrial power — imagine monetising military hardware, vehicles, and tech from Tekne via a debt-free inventory platform. That’s not theory… that’s innovation in motion.

With Tekne now part of the BURU group, backed by defense contracts and NATO-linked programs, we could be looking at the moment where Zamboni’s long-term vision starts to pay off. You can’t question the man’s qualifications or drive — sometimes genius looks a little eccentric before it becomes obvious.

SYME could very well be the fintech piece that fuels the next phase of defense-tech growth under the BURU-Tekne umbrella. Time will tell, but I like where this story’s heading. ⚙️💥"

Then I’ll look up the ticker. Look at their previous news, volume, stock price moments. Etc. 

I will then use search on Reddit for any overview or DD people have posted. What others are saying or if there’s something to look forward to or any upcoming catalysts. 

Then sometimes I’ll use AI, like google finance, and ask any questions I don’t want to comb through random channels like any SEC filings, when their next earnings report, what analysts are saying, risks/red flags etc.

comment,r/pennystocks,nfpjijl,t3_1no3z5t,1758597046,Eft_Reap3r,25,,,"So I like stocks that make sense. Then I take a gamble really. For instance years ago as soon as USA got rare earth embargo’s against it, it was obvious that was going to be a priority due to defence concerns. So I invested in many of these companies. Up between 70-220% but these have been a year or more hold at least. Yes they could have gone down but once you identify the business you want to invest in, finding the right company with good fundamentals is a bit easier because you have fewer targets. 

Otherwise pick something you use all the time. I bought Nvidia because they made the best graphic cards and everyone games. No clue AI would come. But made sense. My kids are addicted to Roblox’s so that made sense. If a product is popular and had a decent business model, chances are it will return a profit. 

After that it’s about timing. Especially being patient and ignoring paper losses unless the fundamentals for which you invested have changed. If price goes down for no reason I couldn’t care less. If it goes down because of bad financials and their model is having issues then different story. But when I first started I would be scared I’m losing my money with these swings. You have to ignore that.

comment,r/pennystocks,nfqhxr9,t3_1no3z5t,1758617407,BanditoBoom,9,,,"There are basically 2 core ways, in my opinion:

1: Look at the obvious stuff that EVERYONE ELSE is looking at, and wait for the market to give you an opportunity. 

Example: Google basically all year until August. Had you simply ignored the bears and did some research you’d see the clear and unmistakable value. If you ONLY bought Google after liberation day, and kept buying every dip…you easily beat the market this year.

2: You gotta look where nowhere else is looking, find the value, and keep buying and wait for the market to recognize what you see. 


Example: Atari being up 50% in the final year of what will be a CLEARLY successful turn around. Mueller Industries being up line 30% - 40% this year since April with over a billion dollars of net cash on the balance sheet, debt free.

Digital Ocean since April. Gitlab getting into gear.

ISSC was a big winner for me this year.

Lumen Technologies in a turnaround could be huge.

Looking at KFS changing their operating model in 2017 and now starting to reap the rewards. Very interesting niche play in SMB Service roll ups.

There is value everywhere (some traditional “value” and others what I call “deep value”).

What are the common denominators?

1: You HAVE to understand the “why” behind your thesis. WHY are you making the bet?

2: Regardless of option 1 (wait for the market to give you an opportunity to buy) or option 2 ( wait for the market to recognize what you see)….you have to be patient."

I also belong to several Reddit investing/stock/trading forums. I pay attention to interesting DD when it's posted. If it's written by AI, I completely and wholly ignore it. LODE, PL, AMPX, ABUS, RKLB &amp; IREN are Reddit stocks that have grown momentum on Reddit and paid me well. I find that Reddit stocks require monitoring and trailing stop losses. Small cap companies are inherently risky. 

Also, check out Charles Schwab themes trading for well vetted small cap companies. The precious minerals theme, blockchain theme, and AI theme are making a pretty penny with almost no DD required. 

The Autotrader app is fairly similar, but more expensive than Schwab themes. I have money in the Pelosi plan and World War III - both have returned greater than 10% in less than 3 months."

comment,r/pennystocks,nftjd4b,t3_1no3z5t,1758655201,SnooRadishes7477,2,,,"I started with bio stocks since I work in oncology.  Back in 2019 I bought a few VKTX shares at $7 because one of my docs was ordering a drug for a treatment before it was FDA approved.  Then a few years later I bought like $150 worth more when it dropped to around $2.25 I think.  It’s been a wild ride watching it go up and down.
Fast forward a few years and I feel like I’ve got a pretty good system down that suits me personally based on my area of expertise.  I’m lucky to have an idea of certain diseases that have many treatments already and some which we are still treating with really old harmful methods that haven’t had good breakthroughs with targeted therapies yet.  My total 19K I’ve invested is around 32K now, but I’ve been super conservative with it all since I choose to spend most of my money gambling 😬.
But to answer your question, I’ll try to sum it up for someone who doesn’t have the same insider knowledge in an industry.  I start with a small investment ($50-$200ish) in different bio stocks in the development phase.  Just starting with the small amount is enough to get it on my radar and into my periodical rounds of research.  As I round and check on trial updates, news, analyst forecasts etc I’ll up my investment for some.  I’ll be watching anywhere from 10-15 at a time.  Some go under but overall I’ve had great returns.  The few that go under are pennies lost compared to the ones that went up 300-1000%."

Apple .. same thing my friend bought apple through his dad's broker there was no internet trading and buying stocks was more difficult... he's doing great... Í bought purple Hooters and strippers .. my point is if your investing for a long-term growth maybe penny stocks are not the way and if you are look for the next big thing look at what you use and like ...things are different today because of retail trading on the Internet and AI  good luck

With stocks like this, you have to protect yourself, manage your risk and ignore the noise and shouts of HODL. Most of the time its bag holders trying to stoke buying pressure in the hope of moving the stock.

Pick your entry level and if it runs dont grab the green candle (bag maker). Ignore it and move on, FOMO will wreck you. For instance I had a stop/limit buy in. The stop was at $1, that was the max I was prepared to buy at."

It dipped 30% last week and hit the “golden zone” at $5.20 Friday close. Even with all the tariff chatter, today’s close jumped to $6.45+. Bulls are waking up, bears are fading. 

On top of that, Richtech Robotics is dropping a new humanoid at NVIDIA GTC 2025 (Oct 27–29). Jetson Thor inside, ready to push automation further into manufacturing, logistics, healthcare… basically anywhere labor is tight. 

Labor shortages + automation = RR’s robots actually matter. Not just hype — real-world use cases already rolling.

Look I get it, maybe you missed out on $BYND, or you bought in too high and are trying to quickly recover your losses with another meme. The thing is, it truly seems like most people aren't even aware of what they're getting into here.

For those not in the know, $ASST aka Strive was founded by Vivek Ramaswamy. Regardless of political views, the man is not exactly the pinnacle of someone you'd want to throw your money behind. He's a snake, plain and simple. This is not a retail movement, this thing has scummy industry and insider trading written all over it. 

Furthermore, the CEO of Citadel (Ken Griffin) owns a significant stake in $BYND and likely got fucked over last week during the squeeze. What better way to recoup losses than by backing a distraction from $BYND and doing a nice lil rug pull here?

This is not financial advice, I'm just warning you all, if you plan on throwing some money on this, just be aware of the risks. Get in quick, and get out faster."

Tonight (Sunday) it will probably spike once overnight market opens (9pm eastern) so people can get in as close to low as possible (may have breaks as people move bags too higher buyers) and people on reddit will be encouraged as it progresses to buy and hold (you can watch and see if/when people are selling).

It’s probably exploitive. But what isn’t these days?

post,r/pennystocks,1odsdxb,,1761188511,Turbulent-Listen8809,513,161.0,A Realistic Look at $BYND: we must get to $3.50 tomorrow,"Can’t cross post here so posting from @biggieruction his post in Wallstreetbets bellow:


A Realistic Look at $BYND

I took a look at the Options Interest and short interest data (see [Options Chart](https://optioncharts.io/options/BYND/open-interest?option_type=all&amp;expiration_dates=all&amp;chart_type=&amp;strike_range=all&amp;view_settings=scroll_to:open-interest-by-expiry-section), [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/bynd), [ChartExchange](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-bynd/borrow-fee/), [CompaniesMarketCap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/beyond-meat/cost-to-borrow/)), and here is what I see in the short-term:

BYND’s short interest is sky-high and borrow rates are expensive, meaning shorts are under pressure. Options flow shows very heavy call open interest around $3–$3.50, with a second cluster near $4–$4.50. The put-call ratio (0.62) leans bullish, so most traders are betting on upside into this Friday’s expiry.

If the stock stays above $3–$3.50 through Thursday, market makers must hedge those calls by buying shares, which tightens supply and can lift the price further. The start of a gamma effect.

If retail volume then pushes the price above $4, that’s the key trigger: dealers’ hedging needs spike, shorts feel squeezed, and we can get a fast upward move as both groups are forced to buy.

If the stock drops back under $3, the effect reverses. Hedges unwind, pressure eases, and the squeeze setup fades.

**Realistic price projections** given the data surrounding the Friday expiry with current options and borrowing data:

* If BYND holds above \~$3.50 through Thursday and volume stays strong, a move into the $4.50–$5.50 range is plausible.
* If BYND breaks above \~$4.00/$4.50 with sustained momentum and short‐covering + hedging kick in, a spike into the $6.00–$7.00 range is within possibility in the short term.
* A move to $10 is very unlikely under current data: it would require a full blow-off squeeze with mass short covering, borrow exhaustion, and no dilution or counter-events. However, strong retail momentum/FOMO forces and/or borrow rates spike higher or brokers call back shares forcing shorts to cover, we could see $10+. 
* If BYND fails to maintain \~$3.00 support or momentum collapses, it could retract back toward \~$2.00 or below.

TLDR: Holding price above $3.50 keeps pressure building; clearing $4.00 with strong volume could light the fuse. If we lose retail momentum, it's good as dead, but there is a real chance if we can just hold the price at a minimum. Good Speed and God Luck friends.

And before that, many others including $TSLA back in 2017 and Bitcoin when it was at $300. I can prove all that.

I'm forced to write this because I don't want to associate my posts to a lot of pump&amp;dump I'm seeing here.

Now that hopefully I clarified that, I want to introduce all of you to a stock that is very under the radar but with massive potential. I like these kind of stocks because their price appreciation is tied to other stocks in the same sector, so basically they're arbitrage opportunities (valuation gap has to close).

I copy here the same post I made on my X account:

$HOND Detailed due diligence and why I believe it's a 7X (700%) multibagger opportunity here

A lot of people are invested in quantum stocks, the $CCCX SPAC or $OKLO and I, myself, recently entered $CCCX with roughly 80K of my money and it's been a good investment and I believe it will continue to go up because it has to close the valuation gap with the other quantum companies.

Now, calculating the implied market cap of the company that merge with the SPAC isn't really easy and it takes a lot of time because we have to account for the pro forma ownership (SPAC shareholders %, company that merge with the SPAC %, PIPE%, Sponsor shares %, Equity from Convertible Debt, ecc) and the redemption rates during the De-SPAC process.

You can't just take the $CCCX market cap right now and say Infleqtion implied market cap is that because it's not. And it's also not the pre-money valuation. To value a SPAC you need to do a lot of DD and many people are either too lazy or just don't know how to do these calculations. In another post I did the calculation for $CCCX and how much the share price has to rise to match the current market cap of $RGTI to close the valuation gap.

Now, let me talk about another SPAC that will have to rise to close the valuation gap with $OKLO. As you all know $OKLO is an advanced nuclear energy/clean tech startup with the goal to design and deploy next generation fission reactors (small modular) that are safer, more compact, and more efficient than traditional large nuclear plants.  
The current market cap is $26.5 billion.

Terrestrial Energy is a company that’s developing Generation IV nuclear reactor technology, specifically a molten salt reactor design.  
Their flagship design is called the Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR).  
The IMSR is a small modular reactor (SMR) that uses molten salt as both the fuel medium (in liquid form) and coolant.  
They're about to go public through a SPAC named $HOND.

Now, without going into too much detail, the TAM for $HOND is $1.2 trillion globally. The TAM for $OKLO is $600-700 billion globally. So $HOND TAM is roughly double the $OKLO TAM.  
But their market cap greatly differ because Terrestrial Energy hasn't benefited from the massive rally that nuclear stocks benefited from as it was still private.  
So instead of being valued $25.6 billion, the pro forma market cap with the SPAC was just $1.3 billion!!  
Now $HOND has a market cap of $675 million. Again, don't make the amateur mistake of taking the SPAC market cap as the implied market cap of Terrestrial Energy.  
We have to account for the Pro Forma Ownership and do all the calculations (Terrestrial Rollover Equity: 71.2%, Public Shareholders of the SPAC: 17.7%, PIPE: 3.8%, Sponsor Shares: 4.4%, Equity from Convertible Debt: 2.9%).

  
We also have to account for redemptions but since $HOND stock price is now around $23.70, logic says there will be very few redemptions. But let's say it will be 20-25% to stay conservative.  
Accounting for all that it gives us an implied market cap of Terrestrial Energy (at the current $HOND market cap) of $4.05 billion (let's say $4 billion).

So, even if we assume we should have the same market cap as $OKLO (despite having double the TAM), we should rise almost 7X from here to close the valuation gap and this doesn't even take into consideration further upside movements in $OKLO.

So $HOND now trades at around $23/share and will have to reach at least $150/share to close the valuation gap with $OKLO.

A 7x multibagger!!

And $HOND is a very under the radar stock, very few people are aware it even exists. In my opinion it's one of the very best asymmetric opportunities in the market right now."

comment,r/pennystocks,njiwu7c,t3_1o6sf6n,1760480235,Otherwise-Coyote6950,39,,,"I just want to say a few more things. The company has a lot of very prominent hedge funds as investors which add even more credibility to the company. One of them is Citadel, one of the most famous and powerful funds in the world, which keeps investing heavily. Citadel Advisors held 69,721 shares of HOND worth about $773,910.

Recently, Citadel purchased an additional 1,163,922 shares of HOND around October 6, 2025. Other major funds are also investing in HOND, including some close to the Trump Administration which have direct knowledge about how important nuclear reactors will be for the future of the US energy sector and its national security. 

Moreover, Terrestrial Energy (HOND) was selected for the DOE’s Fuel Line Pilot Program, which will establish a fuel salt (IMSR) line in a DOE-authorized facility.

That selection is complementary to its participation in the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Pilot Program, meaning it’s part of both reactor and fuel chain development efforts under the DOE.

The U.S. government, through the DOE, has recognized Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR molten-salt technology as part of America’s nuclear supply chain priorities, and direct government investment in the company cannot be ruled out in the future."

comment,r/pennystocks,njj4ydu,t3_1o6sf6n,1760483145,C130J_Darkstar,9,,,"While Terrestrial Energy has some potential (especially in Canada), the argument that it’s “undervalued relative to Oklo” ignores key structural and regulatory realities. Oklo isn’t just a concept-stage company… it’s the first private U.S. company granted Department of Energy pilot program authority (three of the eleven total awards) and has an active reactor site at Idaho National Laboratory where it’s broken ground. Oklo’s Aurora design is a modernized version of EBR-II, a sodium-cooled fast reactor that successfully operated for three decades at the same site, giving it a uniquely proven technical foundation.

Terrestrial’s IMSR design hasn’t yet entered U.S. NRC licensing review, and the company doesn’t hold any U.S. construction or operating licenses. Its agreements so far are preliminary and largely outside the U.S. market. Oklo has also secured HALEU fuel access through DOE contracts- a key bottleneck that Terrestrial still faces… and has established power purchase and development framework agreements totaling over 14 GW, including with Switch, Equinix and Wyoming hyperscale.

Terrestrial’s SPAC valuation looks lower mainly because it’s earlier in both licensing and commercialization- it hasn’t demonstrated an operational test system or secured federal demonstration backing. OKLO is already several phases into the DOE pilot pipeline and under active NRC review for multiple submissions, including its Principal Design Criteria report now being reviewed on an accelerated timeline.

Oklo’s advantage isn’t just hype… it’s positioning and first mover advantage. It has regulatory traction, a proven reactor lineage, secured fuel and siting rights, and tangible commercial demand- all in the U.S. market where AI and data-center needs are growing the fastest. Terrestrial may eventually play a role, but Oklo is clearly ahead in real-world execution."

post,r/pennystocks,1od4h2i,,1761128574,LuchianHelps,439,208.0,🚀 The HYPE is REAL — BYND going vertical!!,"Salutations, degenerates.

Beyond Meat Inc. (ticker: **BYND**) is absolutely exploding, and the momentum train is *on fire*. Not financial advice — just laying out what’s going down.

More and more media outlets are picking this up, and soon it’s gonna reach the normies. Retail’s waking up, algos are lighting up, and shorts are sweating bullets.

All of these articles dropped in the last hour 👇

📈 [Yahoo Finance — “Why Beyond Meat stock is up about 600% in 3 days”](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-beyond-meat-stock-is-up-about-600-in-3-days-093158667.html)  
💎 [TradingView — “BYND rockets 146% as retail traders go for the short squeeze”](https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:065bd5172094b:0-bynd-beyond-meat-stock-rockets-146-as-retail-traders-go-for-the-short-squeeze/)  
🚀 [TS2 Tech — “Beyond Meat stock skyrockets 400% — bubble or bargain?”](https://ts2.tech/en/beyond-meat-stock-skyrockets-400-bubble-or-bargain/)

🔥 [Sherwood News — “Beyond Meat is soaring again — can the fake-meat company turn the meme stock?”](https://sherwood.news/business/beyond-meat-is-soaring-again-can-the-fake-meat-company-turn-the-meme-stock/)

  
The attention machine is spinning up — BYND just got the *GME-era treatment*.  
Retail’s hungry, shorts are trapped, and institutions are pretending they’re not watching.

Hold the line.  
The meat is beyond comprehension. 🥩💎🚀

$BYND to Valhalla."

post,r/pennystocks,1ohbm7j,,1761563688,SitshaIom,439,216.0,GPUS (Hyperscale Data Inc): Undervalued AI/HPC infrastructure microcap,"Hey folks - there’s way too little serious DD on truly undervalued names right now. The market keeps chasing the same five meme tickers while real businesses get ignored. Here’s one of those: **GPUS (Hyperscale Data Inc)** \- a former bitcoin miner that’s just completed its **AI pivot** and is building actual infrastructure for AI/HPC hosting. Remember where you heard it first.

GPUS comes from the mining world, which already has exactly that which AI customers are fighting over: **cheap power, cooling, and big data halls**. Instead of mining bitcoin, they’re now using the same infrastructure to **host GPU servers for AI workloads**. This is not “AI on a PowerPoint” - they’ve **already installed NVIDIA GPUs** and built a base for **commercial AI hosting**. And while peers have been **re-rated** on news and contracts, GPUS is still largely overlooked - with the same setup, the same tailwind, and a far smaller valuation.

# Background

The AI market is exploding, and demand for GPU capacity is massive. But the hyperscalers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) are still **quarters away** from turning on their next waves of campuses. Meanwhile, AI companies need **power, cooling, and ready-made space right now**. That opens a unique window for operators who already have the infrastructure in place.

GPUS originated in bitcoin mining but has clearly pivoted to **AI/HPC infrastructure**. The company owns a **617,000 ft² / 57,000 m² data center campus in Michigan** (hyperscale-size). They currently run \~**30 MW**, with plans to scale to **340 MW** via the local grid and gas backup. In **March**, GPUS installed its first **NVIDIA GPUs** for a Silicon Valley–based cloud customer; the rollout went well and the engagement **expanded in September**. Bottom line: they can deliver AI hosting **today**, not “in three years when the hyperscalers finish their new builds.”

The entire sector is shifting: **bitcoin miners are converting into AI infrastructure** because **GPU hosting yields far better margins** than mining. This is not a blip - it’s the start of a multi-year transition where operators sign **5–10 year AI contracts** and become the backbone of the new compute economy.

Next up, GPUS’s subsidiary **Alliance Cloud Services** plans to launch its own **GPU cloud (H100/B200/B300)** in **H1 2026**, unlocking recurring revenue via hourly billing - think a “mini-CoreWeave,” but at a **microcap** valuation.

# Financial position &amp; cash

They’re also building a **digital asset treasury** (bitcoin) of roughly **$60M** (held + committed purchases). For a microcap that’s meaningful - giving them **capex flexibility** and financing muscle without immediate dilution. In **October**, GPUS also **regained comp.**, meaning the “.BC” flag is removed - important for screens and institutions. This is often where sentiment begins to turn and likely why they’ve been “under the radar” recently.

# Why it’s undervalued

The market is pricing GPUS as if the business barely exists, despite the company:

* Having a **paying customer** and growing capacity
* Owning a **ready campus** with **power + cooling**
* Planning a **commercial GPU cloud**
* **Regaining listing comp.**
* Operating in a **structurally growing AI/HPC market**

In microcaps, it often takes just **one additional customer** to move the needle: **utilization → revenue → multiple** can shift quickly.

# Peers

GPUS is effectively the **same type of story** as **CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR** \- former miners rotating into **AI infrastructure**. That’s exactly the pivot the market has already started to **reward aggressively**. Over the past months, these names have **re-rated** as they moved operations to **building and leasing AI data halls**:

* **CIFR \~+600 percent** (last six months)
* **APLD \~+600 percent** (same period)
* **HUT8 \~+270 percent** (same period)
* **WULF \~+350 percent** (same period), including **+43 percent in a single day** on a Google-backed AI deal (\~$3.7B over 10 years)
* **IREN \~+900 percent** (same period)
* **BTDR** got target hikes after its AI pivot and is up **\~130 percent in six months**

Same pattern every time: **contracts → utilization → multiple expansion**. GPUS hasn’t been re-rated yet - but it’s building into **the same demand**.

Also compare with **Equinix (EQIX)** / **Digital Realty (DLR)** at **$60–80B** market caps - stable giants with low multiple torque. GPUS is a baby in the same ecosystem - **same tailwinds,** far higher upside **per MW/customer.**

# Market dynamics

Estimated **shorting-exposure around 24 percent of float** and rising month-over-month. **Borrow costs** are elevated. If sentiment turns and volume fades, **days-to-cover** can spike. In other words, there’s potential for a sharp move **if** positive news hits (customer, MWs, cloud launch milestones).

# Catalysts

* Public launch of the **GPU cloud (H1 ’26)** with hourly pricing + first named customers  
* **Michigan power build-out** (LOAs, timeline, gas track)  
* Ongoing guidance consistent with spring signals (**$25M Q1 revenue; $115–125M full-year guidance**)  
* Updates on the **digital asset treasury** - financing flexibility into expansion  

# Cleanup

* **Leadership**: CEO is **William B. Horne**. Founder/executive chairman **Milton “Todd” Ault III** has a **history including a 2016–2021 SEC matter**. In **2025**, the company said **Ault intends to step down from officer roles** after a planned divestiture; **Horne remains CEO and becomes Chairman**, with Ault **staying on the board**. Net-net: governance optics **improving**, operational control increasingly consolidated under Horne.  
* **Listing**: The company previously fell out of **NYSE American comp.** (e.g., equity thresholds), but as of **October 2025** it **regained full comp.** and the “.BC” tag is being **removed**. That’s exactly the kind of cleanup institutions like to see - it widens the potential buyer base and removes a headline overhang.  

(If anything, the combo of operational progress + comp. regained is exactly how microcaps graduate into **credible re-rates**.)

# TL;DR

1. Peers (CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR) have already re-rated hard on AI contracts. **GPUS hasn’t re-rated yet.**  
2. In a microcap, **one new customer** can move revenue materially - and the multiple even more.  
3. The **current setup** means any good news can be **amplified**.

The market is currently pricing in “nothing happens.” But **if** GPUS takes *one more step* - a new customer, new MWs, or the GPU cloud going live - the **re-pricing writes itself**. If you want to **front-run the microcap AI re-rating**, GPUS is a classic **asymmetric bet**: limited downside, outsized upside.

Currently holding **30,000 shares**, planning to add more."

So since iam here i made some good profit my year profit is now at 460% it is good i think but i dont invest much and i withdraw from time to time to actually make money and keep some for future investing sooo
1. Never go all in play with money you can afford to lose 
2. This reddit is like a recomendation you have to comb through stocks that are poping but after finding the right one do your own DD and research dont jump straight in 
3. Sometimes take some time to see how the Stock performs in open hours before you jump in dont get stressed and FOMOed
4.dont be scared of losses it simply happens sometimes and take sometime before you invest again dont chase what you lost or you will lose more 
5. Dont try to jump into something every day after a win or loss take some time maybe a week or two before starting hunting again 
6.BIG FOMO help is realising that opportunities will come your way through your whole life dont try to jump in everytime take some time you are not missing out dont be greedy 

Well thats all i have to say idk if it helps its just my perspective on how things go "

Too often, people treat investing like a casino: chasing the jackpot without understanding the fundamentals of businesses or the markets. That mindset can quickly spiral into serious financial and mental stress. So yes, let’s keep repeating it: only invest what you can afford to lose, and always have a clear time horizon for your investments. Horizons can vary depending on the industry or business, but set it, stick to it, and stay disciplined. 

And remember: changing your mind is part of investing. Adapt often as new information comes in. Everything else is noise and there will always be bashers and pumpers trying to profit from it. Stay focused, stay informed, and ignore the distractions."

If you buy a stock pre market or after they charge you 2% above the share price. Same with selling they give you 2% less. So if you’re trading a $100 stock for example if you buy it that could cost you $102. And if you sell that would give you $98. Keep that in mind in his badly you want that penny stock or wanting to sell it.

post,r/pennystocks,1oea1r2,,1761241734,Hehehethatsme,412,428.0,$BYND: Get baited at your own risk,"Hello!

  
This is not a Chat GPT made post regarding $BYND. Basically what happened to $BYND in the last days: a business who got to pennystocks gained traction (catalyst being capybara and his analysis support by his 3M shares). From there, a 0.5$ stock went to \~8.50$. 

However, $BYND was never worth 8.50$ a share. The Walmart deal by it's own doesn't justify a 1500% growth in 2-3 days. What happened? Millions tried to surf the wave and get some profit. Some won 300$, some won 10.000$ and the catalyst for sure won millions with this. 

Anyways we all knew the truth: at some point it will fail and those who are on the tail will face high loses. Thing is you never know if you're on the middle or at the end of the momentum. 

Then, it went downhill. A lot of people lost a lot of money. And you also get a lot of people who didn't wave the momentum, that not regret not having joined at 1-2-3-4$. Or people who bought at 1$ and sold at 2$ regreting having ""only"" a 100% instead of a 500%.

So where are we now? I think it's fair to assume that we're in the point that those two groups that I refer on last paragraph are trying to rise again this corpse stock. Some just to get -20% loses instead of -70%. Some in order to see if they get balls to wave it this time. 

It's a meme stock. Artificially bumped and attached to a company that went from +220$ per share to pennystocks, a company that will likely be in bankrupcy in the next years.

Be careful and get baited at your own risk."

GME happened not because people shopped there and it was a fantastic company, etc. Etc. 

It happened because the movement behind it was bigger than the business, bigger than company itself, and bigger than we thought possible.

If we hold our ground on this, we could really push these buttons.

Beyond Meat has expanded product offerings twice in two days with Walmart being one of them.

They're likely to restructure and have a plan moving forward, unveiled at their earnings in November that was just recently confirmed. 


If we sell, we lose no matter what.

If those that held GME sold instead, we would have lost no matter what.

So, do or don't like fake meat - I don't care.
Do or don't like video games and the like - I don't care.

Something we can all agree on is that we ALL LIKE MONEY.

So why not take a chance when it's presented.

A gamble. A chance. A risk. Is never without its possible downside and never without its possible upside.

ETA: Walmart is not their product offering 😅 rather, Beyond Meat has expanded their product offerings at two retailers in two days, and Walmart is one of those retailers.

They're winding up for big movements in the future - with the debt washed out, I feel like they're moving forward with a longterm strategy in play that's not been made public."

Ultimately, as a blanket, Laymans terms way of saying things: a stock just can’t simply continue going up forever. If it skyrocketed for three days or for three months, you need to be mature enough to realize that everything will suffer their own respective dips. Big deep dips.

You need to be very aware of what stocks are temporary dips worth the hold and which ones will shoot back down and stay down due to the diminishing hype.

I got in at $4.95 and was up $700 when it reached the seven dollar and change price and decided to stick around and I made out selling with a profit of $37 when it dropped.

I decided to go back in later in the day like most of us would do and I got in at $3.95 and we all know it went downhill from there. 

This morning I took a big chance and did a limit order and put in $4000 to get my average down to $2.79 with the hope that it would spike just enough to a sell price of $3.00 at market open. 

In total, I made $80 on this short squeeze. And I am completely content of getting out of this in the green.

If this weeks events is considered a historic short squeeze due to the volume then I’m happy to say I was part of that and I can walk away guilt free without a ton of profit."

My favorite of the fake meats, and I eat regular meat, but sometimes crave beyond burgers. They changed thier product recently and it tanked. Now they're back to their quality product. A household name, with a stock that was once $250 now 99% down and extremely undervalued in my opinion. Funny enough it then became a meme and ripped a 20x. However, fake meat is not some old idea struggling to survive, such as GME. It's a company that produces a new kind of food product that isn't going anywhere. Fake meat had all the hype of a bubble, and the bubble popped. Now it's time for finding the fair value of Beyond and that will happen in the coming years. I sold almost all my shares on the way up, but when the meme dust settles I'll be eyeing it as a legit investment once again."

I stopped for a while. Seeing that I’m not good at it. But thought I’d give it a try after a long while and saw the hype. Waited on bynd and waited. Then after all that and the attention, I really thought high 6s would go to at least 10, or more. Given whatever crazy shit had happened with plenty of other hyped up stocks. This got a lot of attention and my god look at the volume. But dammit. Fuck me. If the shorts weren’t ready for it all. Seems like they really had a handle on it and crushed it just as fast as I hit the buy button. Within minutes. Then I thought about the big swings which come with such volume. Nope. Never gonna get any of that action fomosexual. Just straight down for you sucker! Fml.

If you don't already have a position, the risk/reward on this is completely asymmetric to buy in at this point. Cause this stock rising relies on folks continuing to pile in and holding, when there's a huge cohort of current bagholders waiting to offload from $4-7, many of them inexperienced FOMO buyers that'll jump ship when their promise of a further 500% squeeze isn't realized in the next couple days.

I didn’t manage to catch the first few trains of BYND but entered close to the all time high period $8 but was buying/selling shares for a small profits $400-$600/day and went for options as well.

The narrative will always be identical, why some people still don’t learn from their mistakes? MM always win, they learn from GME mistake.
