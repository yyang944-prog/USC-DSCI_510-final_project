&gt; The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June. That decline also marked the end of a structural bull cycle for the dollar, which started in 2010 and ended in 2024 with an accumulated gain of about 40%. 

&gt; Although the currency strengthened 3.2% in July, recovering some of this year’s depreciation, Morgan Stanley Research expects the decline to continue, possibly adding another 10% in losses by the end of next year.  “We're likely at the intermission rather than the finale,” says David Adams, head of G10 FX Strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The second act for the dollar’s weakening should come over the next 12 months, as U.S. interest rates and growth converge with those of the rest of the world.” 

&gt; The U.S. currency depreciation could have significant impacts for consumers, businesses, investors and ultimately for the overall economy: It would be more expensive for Americans to travel abroad. U.S. assets could be less compelling for foreign investors. Import prices could rise, putting pressure on inflation. On the positive side, however, the weaker dollar could be a boost for American exporters."

a weaker dollar is anything but a boost for american exporters.

the usa doesn't export crap out that competes with the same crap from somewhere else.  ag products barely count.

it makes shit that you literally cannot buy anywhere else.  more specifically, the usa buys basic parts and materiel from elsewhere and turns it into expensive things.  most of which make other things explode.

a weak dollar means the input costs are higher, so even if output sales numbers are higher the whole thing is a wash."

The MSCI ex-US index is now outperforming MSCI US, and by the largest margin since 2009, a striking reversal after nearly twenty years of US dominance. For years, the narrative of US exceptionalism in markets has held strong, powered by tech innovation, easy monetary policy, and global capital inflows. But with valuations stretched, on-off-paused tariffs, increased corruption, unprecedented government interference in business, a weakened dollar and constant threats to Jay Powell and other FED board members, many investors are clearly beginning to look elsewhere."

Problem is if US investors go and invest in these markets, and when they take out their money and bring back two dollars, they will suffer a huge loss because the currency keeps on depreciating and the returns. Those Market are making are not enough. For example if a outside us Market makes 16% return and depreciated their currency by 6% then you only made 10% when you got your money back in dollars. So compare the returns in dollar terms not in their own currencies.

If we compare in dollar terms, people will find that US markets have continuously outperformed every year as compared to other markets"

I am just never using them again, and honestly blame them because why would a single sign on in 3 years with immediate transfers and bank withdrawals and frantic shuffling all of a sudden not flag the account and of course they had no reachable phone service 🙄.

The first CEO says to the other “I’ll pay you $100 billion to eat that pile of shit.” The second CEO takes the $100 billion and eats the pile of shit.

They continue walking until they come across a second pile of shit. The second CEO turns to the first and says “I’ll pay you $100 billion to eat that pile of shit.” The first CEO takes the $100 billion and eats a pile of shit.

Walking a little more, the first CEO looks at the second and says, ""You know, I gave you $100 billion to eat shit, then you gave me back the same $100 billion to eat shit. I can't help but feel like we both just ate shit for nothing.""

Even us regards on WSB have figured out this ain't good.

The unhealthy part has become marked by “related-party transactions” like the ones involving these companies, he said, which can artificially prop up the value of the firms involved.

“If investors decide the ties among the AI giants are getting too close, he said, ***there will be some deflating activity.” That’s Wall Street-speak for a bubble’s bursting.***

***In WSB speak we say dump eeeetttttttt.***"
comment,r/wallstreetbets,ni5cmgt,t3_1nzx2hv,1759789492,shasta747,24,,,"The more I read about this deal, the more I think this is a bad trade for AMD.

So NVDA is filthy rich, papa Jensen could afford giving $100B for Sam to buy more GPUs thru Larry's Oracle. But it sounds like mama Su doesn't have this money, so to make OpenAI buy more AMD chips, she has to give Sam 10% of the company, which is a huge stake.

The only case when this works out well is OpenAI makes huge profit in order to buy enough AMD chips (I doubt Jensen is happy with his money spending on AMD) to meet the conditions of that 10% deal."
